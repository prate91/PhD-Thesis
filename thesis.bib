Discovering and linking this information poses eminent research challenges to the geospatial semantic web, with regards to the representation and manipulation of geographic data. Towards addressing these challenges, this work explores the potential of the current semantic web languages and tools. In particular, an integrated logical framework of rules and ontologies, using current W3C standards, is assessed for modeling geospatial ontologies of place encoding both symbolic and geometric references to place locations. Spatial reasoning is incorporated in the framework to facilitate the deduction of implicit semantics and for expressing spatial integrity constraints. The logical framework is then extended with geo-computation engines that offer more effective manipulations of geometric information. Example data sets mined from web resources are used to demonstrate and evaluate both frameworks, offering insights to their potentials and limitations.},

Story maps are interactive online digital narratives that can describe a territory beyond its map by enriching the map with text, pictures, videos, and other multimedia information. This paper presents a semi-automatic workflow to produce story maps from textual documents containing territory data. An expert first assembles one territory-contextual document containing text and images. Then, automatic processes use natural language processing and Wikidata services to (i) extract key concepts (entities) and geospatial coordinates associated with the territory, (ii) assemble a logically-ordered sequence of enriched story-map events, and (iii) openly publish online story maps and an interoperable Linked Open Data semantic knowledge base for event exploration and inter-story correlation analyses. Our workflow uses an Open Science-oriented methodology to publish all processes and data. Through our workflow, we produced story maps for the value chains and territories of 23 rural European areas of 16 countries. Through numerical evaluation, we demonstrated that territory experts considered the story maps effective in describing their territories, and appropriate for communicating with citizens and stakeholders.},

  abstract = {The representation of temporal information has been in the center of intensive research activities over the years in the areas of knowledge representation, databases and more recently, the Semantic Web. The proposed approach extends the existing framework of representing temporal information in ontologies by allowing for representation of concepts evolving in time (referred to as ``dynamic'' information) and of their properties in terms of qualitative descriptions in addition to quantitative ones (i.e., dates, time instants and intervals). For this purpose, we advocate the use of natural language expressions, such as ``before'' or ``after'', for temporal entities whose exact durations or starting and ending points in time are unknown. Reasoning over all types of temporal information (such as the above) is also an important research problem. The current work addresses all these issues as follows: The representation of dynamic concepts is achieved using the ``4D-fluents'' or, alternatively, the ``N-ary relations'' mechanism. Both mechanisms are thoroughly explored and are expanded for representing qualitative and quantitative temporal information in OWL. In turn, temporal information is expressed using either intervals or time instants. Qualitative temporal information representation in particular, is realized using sets of SWRL rules and OWL axioms leading to a sound, complete and tractable reasoning procedure based on path consistency applied on the existing relation sets. Building upon existing Semantic Web standards (OWL), tools and member submissions (SWRL), as well as integrating temporal reasoning support into the proposed representation, are important design features of our approach.},

Also, RDF can easily represent spatial relationships, as long as the location information is symbolic, i.e., represented by places that have a name. What is widely missing is support for geographic and geometric information, such as coordinates or spatial polygons, which is needed in many applications that deal with sensor data or map data. This calls for efficient data management systems which are capable of querying large amounts of RDF data and support spatial query predicates. We present a native RDF triple store implementation with deeply integrated spatial query functionality. We model spatial features in RDF as literals of a complex geometry type and express spatial predicates as SPARQL filter functions on this type. This makes it possible to use W3C's standardized SPARQL query language as-is, i.e., without any modifications or extensions for spatial queries. We evaluate the characteristics of our system on very large data volumes.},

  abstract = {Formal ontologies have proved to be a very useful tool to manage interoperability among data, systems and knowledge. In this paper we will show how formal ontologies can evolve from a crisp, deterministic framework (ontologies of hard knowledge) to new probabilistic, fuzzy or possibilistic frameworks (ontologies of soft knowledge). This can considerably enlarge the application potential of formal ontologies in geographic analysis and planning, where soft knowledge is intrinsically linked to the complexity of the phenomena under study. The paper briefly presents these new uncertainty-based formal ontologies. It then highlights how ontologies are formal tools to define both concepts and relations among concepts. An example from the domain of urban geography finally shows how the cause-to-effect relation between household preferences and urban sprawl can be encoded within a crisp, a probabilistic and a possibilistic ontology, respectively. The ontology formalism will also determine the kind of reasoning that can be developed from available knowledge. Uncertain ontologies can be seen as the preliminary phase of more complex uncertainty-based models. The advantages of moving to uncertainty-based models is evident: whether it is in the analysis of geographic space or in decision support for planning, reasoning on geographic space is almost always reasoning with uncertain knowledge of geographic phenomena.},

The first method is an extension of the geometric point-set approach by taking the dimension of the intersections into account. This results in a very large number of different topological relationships for point, line, and area features. In the second method, which aims to be more suitable for humans, we propose to group all possible cases into a few meaningful topological relationships and we discuss their exclusiveness and completeness with respect to the point-set approach.},

The need for spatial representations and spatial reasoning is ubiquitous in artificial intelligence (AI) from robot planning and navigation to interpreting visual inputs to understanding natural language. In all these cases, the need to represent and reason about spatial aspects of the world is of key importance. Related fields of research such as geographic information science (GIScience) have also driven the spatial representation and reasoning community to produce efficient, expressive, and useful calculi. There has been considerable research in spatial representations that are based on metric measurements, in particular within the vision and robotics communities, and also on raster and vector representations in GIScience. This chapter focuses on symbolic and, in particular, qualitative representations. The challenge of qualitative spatial reasoning (QSR) is to provide calculi that allow a machine to represent and reason with spatial entities without resort to the traditional quantitative techniques prevalent in, for example, computer graphics or computer vision communities.},

This can be achieved by combining existing calculi in a way that we can express spatial information using relations from multiple calculi. The great challenge is to develop reasoning algorithms that are correct and complete when reasoning over the combined information. Previous work has mainly studied cases where the interaction between the combined calculi was small, or where one of the two calculi was very simple. In this paper we tackle the important combination of topological and directional information for extended spatial objects. We combine some of the best known calculi in qualitative spatial reasoning, the RCC8 algebra for representing topological information, and the Rectangle Algebra (RA) and the Cardinal Direction Calculus (CDC) for directional information. We consider two different interpretations of the RCC8 algebra, one uses a weak connectedness relation, the other uses a strong connectedness relation. In both interpretations, we show that reasoning with topological and directional information is decidable and remains in NP. Our computational complexity results unveil the significant differences between RA and CDC, and that between weak and strong RCC8 models. Take the combination of basic RCC8 and basic CDC constraints as an example: we show that the consistency problem is in P only when we use the strong RCC8 algebra and explicitly know the corresponding basic RA constraints.},

The pros and cons of developing global ontologies are discussed. It is argued that core ontologies of relationships are fundamental to schema integration and play a completely different role to that of specialist terminologies in practical knowledge management. The CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) is presented as an example of such a global model. It is a core ontology and new ISO standard (ISO 21127, accepted September 2006), originally designed for the semantic integration of information from museums, libraries, and archives. It is a product of re-engineering the dominant underlying common concepts from representative data structures. It is not prescriptive, but provides a controlled language to describe common high-level semantics that allow for information integration at the schema level. The tutorial addresses part of the technology needed for information aggregation and integration in the global information environment, namely the question to which extent and in which form global schema integration is feasible. The ability of the CRM to support integration has been demonstrated in a large range of different domains including cultural heritage, e-science and biodiversity. Conceptual modeling by specializing such a well-tested core ontology not only reduces drastically development time and improves system quality, but provides basic semantic interoperability more or less for free. The tutorial will present characteristic applications.},

  abstract = {There is a rising interest to enrich cultural heritage data with precise and well identified descriptions of location and geometry of sites of historical events or remains, objects and natural features. The ``geospatial community'' and the ``cultural heritage community'' have developed standards reflecting different foci -- the OGC/ISO Standards for Geographic Information and the ontology of the CIDOC CRM which is the ISO standard for representing cultural heritage information. This report introduces the CRMgeo extension for the CIDOC CRM to provide an ``articulation'' (linkage) between the standards of the geospatial and the cultural heritage community in particular between GeoSPARQL and CIDOC CRM. The model was developed from the analysis of the epistemological processes of defining, using and determining places. This means that we analyzed how a question, such as ``is this the place of the Varus Battle'' or ``is this the place where Lord Nelson died'', can be verified or falsified, including geometric specifications. Consequently, we reached at a detailed model which seems to give a complete account of all practical components necessary to verify such a question, in agreement with the laws of physics, the practice of geometric measurement and archaeological reasoning. This model indeed appears to have the capability to link both ontologies and shows the way how to correctly reconcile data at any scale and time -- not by inventing precision or truth that cannot be acquired, but by quantifying or delimiting the inherent indeterminacies, as it is good practice in natural sciences. This model aims at being a comprehensive theory from which mutually compatible simplification can be derived for implementations in more constraint environment, such at those lacking moving frames.},

A comprehensive formal catego- rization of such binary topological relations between regions, lines, and points has been developed that is based upon the comparison of the nine intersections between the interiors, boundaries, and exteriors of the two objects. The basic criterion for the distinction of different topological relations is whether the intersections are empty or not, thus identifying 2 mutually exclusive topological re- lations. It is derived which of these 512 binary relations actually exist in IR between regions, lines, and points. An equivalent model is developed that replaces the intersections with exteriors by sub- set conditions of the closure so that efficient implementations of topological relations are possible in geographic information systems.},

Terms like close and far or North and South are not as clearly understood as the standard relationships between integer numbers. The treatment of relationships among spatial objects is an essential task in geographic data processing and CAD/CAM. Spatial query languages, for example, must offer terms for spatial relationships; spatial database management systems need algorithms to determine relationships. Hence, a formal definition of spatial relationships is necessary to clarify the users' diverse understanding of spatial relationships and to actually deduce relationships among spatial objects. Based upon such formalisms, spatial reasoning and inference will be possible.},

  abstract = {The problem of concept representation is relevant for many subfields of cognitive research, including psychology and philosophy, as well as artificial intelligence. In particular, in recent years it has received a great deal of attention within the field of knowledge representation, due to its relevance for both knowledge engineering as well as ontology-based technologies. However, the notion of a concept itself turns out to be highly disputed and problematic. In our opinion, one of the causes of this state of affairs is that the notion of a concept is, to some extent, heterogeneous, and encompasses different cognitive phenomena. This results in a strain between conflicting requirements, such as compositionality, on the one hand and the need to represent prototypical information on the other. In some ways artificial intelligence research shows traces of this situation. In this paper, we propose an analysis of this current state of affairs. Since it is our opinion that a mature methodology with which to approach knowledge representation and knowledge engineering should also take advantage of the empirical results of cognitive psychology concerning human abilities, we outline some proposals for concept representation in formal ontologies, which take into account suggestions from psychological research. Our basic assumption is that knowledge representation systems whose design takes into account evidence from experimental psychology (and which, therefore, are more similar to the human way of organizing and processing information) may therefore give better results in many applications (e.g. in the fields of information retrieval and semantic web).},

  abstract = {A hazard is a natural occurrence that might harm humans, animals or the environment. It may cause loss of life, illness or other health consequences, property damage, social and economic crisis or environmental degradation. Many places of the world are at risk from one or more disasters. Although many studies have concentrated on single hazards, there is a need for integrated evaluations of multi-hazards for more effective land management. A selection of datasets and methods, such as meteorological data, satellite images, and GIS, were used to create the risk assessment maps. The parameters for multi-hazard assessment are mainly considered as rainfall, slope, elevation, and land use/land cover and create a map in a GIS environment. For a particular region, multi-hazards can be produced by integrating maps of several hazard assessments. The objective of this study is an integration of geospatial and fuzzy-logic techniques for multi-hazard mapping. Extensive parts of Gujarat state (India) experience a wide range of natural hazards: floods, soil erosion, drought, and earthquakes. This research creates and evaluates individual and group multi-hazard maps to visualize the spatial variation of hazards in Gujarat state, India. The calculated four individual hazard maps have been categorised into five classes: very-low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The multi hazard map has been classified into sixteen classes using the GIS unsupervised. This study aims to improve disaster preparedness, enhance land management, or guide decision-making for disaster risk reduction. This study can be helpful in the future to engineers, planners, and local governments in the field of spatial planning and natural disaster management.},

In order to formalize these tasks as reasoning problems, we introduce the notions of conservative extension, safety and module for a very general class of logic-based ontology languages. We investigate the general properties of and relationships between these notions  and study the relationships between the relevant reasoning problems we have previously identified. To study the computability of these problems, we   consider, in particular, Description Logics (DLs), which provide the formal underpinning of the W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL), and show that all the  problems we consider are undecidable or algorithmically unsolvable for the description logic underlying OWL DL.  In order to achieve a practical solution, we identify conditions sufficient for an ontology to reuse a set of symbols ``safely''---that is, without changing their meaning. We provide the notion of a safety class, which characterizes any sufficient condition for safety, and identify a family of safety classes--called locality---which enjoys a collection of desirable properties.  We use the notion of a safety class to extract modules from ontologies, and we provide various modularization algorithms that are appropriate to the properties of the particular safety class in use.  Finally, we show practical benefits of our safety checking and module extraction algorithms.},

  abstract = {The integration of the raster data cube alongside another form of geospatial data (e.g., vector data) raises considerable challenges when it comes to managing and representing it using knowledge graphs. Such integration can play an invaluable role in handling the heterogeneity of geospatial data and linking the raster data cube to semantic technology standards. Many recent approaches have been attempted to address this issue, but they often lack robust formal elaboration or solely concentrate on integrating raster data cubes without considering the inclusion of semantic spatial entities along with their spatial relationships. This may constitute a major shortcoming when it comes to performing advanced geospatial queries and semantically enriching geospatial models. In this paper, we propose a framework that can enable such semantic integration and advanced querying of raster data cubes based on the virtual knowledge graph (VKG) paradigm. This framework defines a semantic representation model for raster data cubes that extends the GeoSPARQL ontology. With such a model, we can combine the semantics of raster data cubes with features-based models that involve geometries as well as spatial and topological relationships. This could allow us to formulate spatiotemporal queries using SPARQL in a natural way by using ontological concepts at an appropriate level of abstraction. We propose an implementation of the proposed framework based on a VKG system architecture. In addition, we perform an experimental evaluation to compare our framework with other existing systems in terms of performance and scalability. Finally, we show the potential and the limitations of our implementation and we discuss several possible future works.},

  abstract = {Geospatial extensions of SPARQL, like GeoSPARQL and stSPARQL, have been defined since 2007 and while several geospatial RDF stores have implemented a substantial part of these extensions, other stores limited their support mostly on point geometry features. A parallel process with the above was that RDF frameworks evolved in an interesting way by presenting a more mature set of geospatial features, such as GeoSPARQL support and including the latest indexing technologies. As a logical consequence, a shift in the use of RDF frameworks is to be expected, from base platforms that users extend to create more complete geospatial RDF stores, to attractive finished RDF solutions for many geospatial applications. Alongside with the ever-increasing size of linked geospatial data that semantic stores need to handle, all the above provided our group the motivation to improve our single node systems benchmark Geographica, originally defined in 2013. Geographica 2 is more comprehensive, because it now includes new geospatial RDF stores and frameworks, big real world datasets of many hundred million triples with up to fifty million features of complex geometries, new tests and queries that reveal the scalability of these systems. The augmented and revised real world workload of Geographica 2 tests the efficiency of primitive spatial functions in RDF stores, their performance in the geocoding scenario against the new Census dataset in addition to many other real use case scenarios and finally includes computation of statistics for geospatial datasets. A more detailed and systematic evaluation is performed using the synthetic workload. The new scalability workload aims at discovering the limits of centralized geospatial RDF stores of various architectures. It employs a set of six well balanced real world datasets with highly complex geometries covering many European countries and compares three RDF stores in terms of storage space, bulk loading and query response time. In addition, a special version of the benchmark has been created for systems with limited geospatial functionality and two more systems of this category are introduced along the six systems of the main benchmark, all stressed against point-only subsets of the workloads. Three out of the eight systems use an RDBMS for the persistence layer, while some of them offer a variety of persistence options.},

Traditionally, humans interact with geospatial data through software (e.g., ArcGIS 10.3) and programming languages (e.g., Python). As a pioneer study, we explore the possibility of using an LLM as an interface to interact with geospatial datasets through natural language. To achieve this, we also propose a framework to (1) train an LLM to understand the datasets, (2) generate geospatial SQL queries based on a natural language question, (3) send the SQL query to the backend database, (4) parse the database response back to human language. As a proof of concept, a case study was conducted on real-world data to evaluate its performance on various queries. The results show that LLMs can be accurate in generating SQL code for most cases, including spatial joins, although there is still room for improvement. As all geospatial data can be stored in a spatial database, we hope that this framework can serve as a proxy to improve the efficiency of spatial data analyses and unlock the possibility of automated geospatial analytics.},

However, what the community is missing is a comprehensive and objective way to measure the extent of GeoSPARQL support in GeoSPARQL-enabled RDF triplestores. To fill this gap, we developed the GeoSPARQL compliance benchmark. We propose a series of tests that check for the compliance of RDF triplestores with the GeoSPARQL standard, in order to test how many of the requirements outlined in the standard a tested system supports. This topic is of concern because the support of GeoSPARQL varies greatly between different triplestore implementations, and the extent of support is of great importance for different users. In order to showcase the benchmark and its applicability, we present a comparison of the benchmark results of several triplestores, providing an insight into their current GeoSPARQL support and the overall GeoSPARQL support in the geospatial linked data domain.},

  abstract = {Prediction of structural complexity for geohazard and subsurface resource applications requires constraining and interpreting data that are often ambiguous or lack key information. Moreover, structural complexity is a subjective term, requiring context for quantification. Recognizing this, a new knowledge-data framework and a geospatial fuzzy logic method is developed to represent and predict structural complexity in the subsurface. A conceptual model for known structural complexity serves as a basis for associating geospatial representations with types of damage zones. A second conceptual model for zones of structural complexity facilitates its prediction, notably in areas with limited explicit structural data. For each conceptual model, a fuzzy logic inference model is developed to incorporate geospatial data and estimate structural complexity potential. This approach is demonstrated using several public geospatial datasets within the state of Oklahoma. Explicit fault and earthquake location data were integrated using a fuzzy model of known structural complexity to train topographic, lithologic, and geophysical proxy datasets, applied to a fuzzy model to predict structural complexity, and evaluated with Receiver Operating Characteristic analyses and error classification. The final model output, displayed in maps and cross sections, offers comparison with interpreted structural data for validation. Together, these results demonstrate the effectiveness and limitations of the new approach as a screening tool for predicting structurally complex areas.},

It introduces a new generation of geospatial technologies that have emerged from the development of the Semantic Web and the Linked Data paradigm, and shows how data scientists can use them to build environmental applications easily. Geospatial data science is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and visualizing geospatial data. Since around 2010, there has been extensive work in the area of geospatial data science using semantic technologies and linked data, from researchers in the areas of the Semantic Web, Geospatial Databases and Geoinformatics. The main results of this research have been the publication of the OGC standard GeoSPARQL and the implementation of a number of linked data tools supporting this standard. Up to now, there has been no textbook that enables someone to teach this material to undergraduate or graduate students. The material of the book is developed in a tutorial style and it is appropriate for an introductory course on the subject. This can be an advanced undergraduate course or a graduate course offered by Computer Science or GIS faculty. It is a hands-on approach and every chapter contains exercises that help students master the material. The book is accompanied by a Web site: https://ai.di.uoa.gr/geospatial-data-science-book/index.html where solutions to some of the exercises are given together with supplementary material such as datasets and code. Most of the material in the book has been tried in the ``Knowledge Technologies'' course taught by the editor in the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens since 2012.},

For this purpose, we develop the data model stRDF and the query language stSPARQL. stRDF is a constraint data model that extends RDF with the ability to represent spatial and temporal data. stSPARQL extends SPARQL for querying stRDF data. In our extension to RDF, we follow the main ideas of constraint databases and represent spatial and temporal objects as quantifier-free formulas in a first-order logic of linear constraints. Thus an important contribution of stRDF is to bring to the RDF world the benefits of constraint databases and constraint-based reasoning so that spatial and temporal data can be represented in RDF using constraints.},

The notion of event is taken to be more primitive than that of time and both are represented explicitly by means of Horn clauses augmented with negation by failure. The main intended applications are the updating of databases and narrative understanding. In contrast with conventional databases which assume that updates are made in the same order as the corresponding events occur in the real world, the explicit treatment of events allows us to deal with updates which provide new information about the past. Default reasoning on the basis of incomplete information is obtained as a consequence of using negation by failure. Default conclusions are automatically withdrawn if the addition of new information renders them inconsistent. Because events are differentiated from times, we can represent events with unknown times, as well as events which are partially ordered and concurrent.},

By then, however, they had produced essays that remain among the best defenses ever written for both literature and its theory.

Victor Shklovsky's pioneering "Art as Technique" (1917) defines the literary as a way to make us see familiar things as if for the first time. His 1921 essay on Tristram Shandy makes that eccentric novel the centerpiece for a theory of narrative. A section from Boris Tomashevsky's "Thematics" (1925) inventories the elements of stories. In "The Theory of the 'Formal Method'" (1927), Boris Eichenbaum defends Russian Formalism against various attacks. An able champion, he describes Formalism's evolution, notes its major figures and works, clears away decayed axioms, and rescues literature from "primitive historicism" and other dangers. These essays set a course for literary studies that led to Prague structuralism, French semiotics, and postmodern poetics.

One approach to this problem is to formalize commonsense reasoning using mathematical logic. Commonsense Reasoning is a detailed, high-level reference on logic-based commonsense reasoning. It uses the event calculus, a highly powerful and usable tool for commonsense reasoning, which Erik T. Mueller demonstrates as the most effective tool for the broadest range of applications. He provides an up-to-date work promoting the use of the event calculus for commonsense reasoning, and bringing into one place information scattered across many books and papers. Mueller shares the knowledge gained in using the event calculus and extends the literature with detailed event calculus solutions to problems that span many areas of the commonsense world.Covers key areas of commonsense reasoning including action, change, defaults, space, and mental states.The first full book on commonsense reasoning to use the event calculus. Contextualizes the event calculus within the framework of commonsense reasoning, introducing the event calculus as the best method overall. Focuses on how to use the event calculus formalism to perform commonsense reasoning, while existing papers and books examine the formalisms themselves.

  abstract = {Since the end of the 20th century the widespread use of digital applications in archaeology has legitimized their inclusion in the archaeological toolbox. Together with archaeological sciences, databases, GIS and other computer-based methods are nowadays present in every respectable archaeological investigation. This makes archaeology a peculiar discipline, where the scientific method combines with the historical one to produce new knowledge. However, the large availability of archaeological data creates the risk of a data deluge and may suggest using online information just to collect previous interpretations rather than to re-use the data supporting them. A `Grand Challenges' list compiled some years ago includes important research questions that undergird contemporary issues and require an appropriate digital methodology to be addressed. The present paper discusses the benefits, or better the absolute need, of a data-centric methodology to address large-scale research. It argues that an acritical use of the so-called `Big Data' approach may be questionable. It suggests how the combination of artificial intelligence with human intelligence is the key to progress into the understanding of phenomena of paramount societal importance for researchers and for the public at large.},

In the context of the Web, incomplete information issues have been studied in detail for XML, but very few papers exist that do the same for RDF. In this paper we make the first general proposal for extending RDF with the ability to represent property values that exist but are unknown or partially known using constraints. Following ideas from incomplete information literature, we develop a semantics for this extension of RDF, called RDFi, and study query evaluation for SPARQL. We transfer the concept of representation systems from incomplete information in relational databases to the case of RDFi and identify two very important fragments of SPARQL that can be used to define a representation system for RDFi. The first corresponds to the monotone fragment of graph patterns that uses only the operators AND, UNION, and FILTER. The second corresponds to the well-designed graph patterns, that is, a fragment that uses only operators AND, FILTER, and OPT, and enjoys interesting properties that make query evaluation efficient. We prove that each of the two fragments can be used to define a representation system for CONSTRUCT queries without blank nodes in their templates. We also define the fundamental concept of certain answers to SPARQL queries over RDFi databases and present an algorithm for its computation. Then, we present complexity results for computing certain answers by considering equality, temporal, and spatial constraint languages and the class of CONSTRUCT queries of our representation systems. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of RDFi in geospatial Semantic Web applications by giving a number of examples and comparing the modeling capabilities of RDFi with related formalisms found in the literature.},

  abstract = {The amount of digital cultural heritage data produced by cultural heritage institutions is growing rapidly. Digital cultural heritage repositories have therefore become an efficient and effective way to disseminate and exploit digital cultural heritage data. However, many digital cultural heritage repositories worldwide share technical challenges such as data integration and interoperability among national and regional digital cultural heritage repositories. The result is dispersed and poorly-linked cultured heritage data, backed by non-standardized search interfaces, which thwart users' attempts to contextualize information from distributed repositories. A recently introduced geospatial semantic web is being adopted by a great many new and existing digital cultural heritage repositories to overcome these challenges. However, no one has yet conducted a conceptual survey of the geospatial semantic web concepts for a cultural heritage audience. A conceptual survey of these concepts pertinent to the cultural heritage field is, therefore, needed. Such a survey equips cultural heritage professionals and practitioners with an overview of all the necessary tools, and free and open source semantic web and geospatial semantic web platforms that can be used to implement geospatial semantic web-based cultural heritage repositories. Hence, this article surveys the state-of-the-art geospatial semantic web concepts, which are pertinent to the cultural heritage field. It then proposes a framework to turn geospatial cultural heritage data into machine-readable and processable resource description framework (RDF) data to use in the geospatial semantic web, with a case study to demonstrate its applicability. Furthermore, it outlines key free and open source semantic web and geospatial semantic platforms for cultural heritage institutions. In addition, it examines leading cultural heritage projects employing the geospatial semantic web. Finally, the article discusses attributes of the geospatial semantic web that require more attention, that can result in generating new ideas and research questions for both the geospatial semantic web and cultural heritage fields.},

The requirement of Allen operators for complete temporal knowledge goes against the monotonic knowledge generation sequence, which is witnessed in observation driven fields like stratigraphy. In such cases, incomplete temporal information yields a disjunctive set of Allen operators, which affects RDF reasoning since it leads to expensive queries containing unions. To address this deficiency, we introduce a set of basic temporal primitives, which comprise the minimum possible and yet sufficient temporal knowledge, between associated time intervals. This flexible representation can describe any Allen operator as well as scenarios with further temporal generalization using logical conjunctions. Furthermore, an extension to the basic set of primitives is proposed, introducing primitives of improper inequality, which describe scenarios with increased imprecision that reflect disjunctive temporal topologies. Finally, the proposed temporal primitives are employed in an extension of CIDOC CRM.},

This is especially true in analytical applications ranging from scientific discovery to national security and criminal investigation. The analytical process often requires uncovering and analyzing complex thematic relationships between disparate people, places and events. Fundamentally new query operators based on the graph structure of Semantic Web data models, such as semantic associations, are proving useful for this purpose. However, these analysis mechanisms are primarily intended for thematic relationships. In this paper, we describe a framework built around the RDF data model for analysis of thematic, spatial and temporal relationships between named entities. We present a spatiotemporal modeling approach that uses an upper-level ontology in combination with temporal RDF graphs. A set of query operators that use graph patterns to specify a form of context are formally defined. We also describe an efficient implementation of the framework in Oracle DBMS and demonstrate the scalability of our approach with a performance study using both synthetic and real-world RDF datasets of over 25 million triples.},

Digitizing and web, beside its benefits, brought some challenges in disseminating and retrieving CH information, which has heterogeneous content varying widely in type and properties yet encompassing rich semantic links. Semantic web technologies, especially ontologies, provide a common understanding inside a domain that helps sharing knowledge and interoperability. They can be very helpful in data modeling for a better information retrieval compared to relational databases as they take into account the semantics of information, guarantee reusability, and make information machine-readable that can offer more flexibility to intelligent services and applications. CH community is one of the first domains to make use semantic web technologies to deal with this issue. CIDOC CRM is the most used and famous ontology in CH domain, which is an ISO standard since 2006. Heritage sites are composed of many points of interest that attract visitors to find out about them. However, information about a particular POI is complex and interconnected with other people, events, and objects. In this paper, we aim to develop a POI-based data model for heritage sites in Iran using concepts from CIDOC CRM integrated with GeoSPARQL, the standard ontology in geospatial field, to incorporate spatial semantics with heritage information. This way the user can freely explore their preferred information about the places they desire. This can make it possible to use the data model for location-based services and applications in heritage sites.},

This includes the problem of representing arbitrary spatial regions in a computational framework, leading to the problem of generating a realization of a consistent set of RCC-8 constraints. A further problem is that RCC-8 performs reasoning about topological space, which does not have a particular dimension. Most applications of spatial reasoning, however, deal with two- or threedimensional space. Therefore, a consistent set of RCC-8 constraints might not be realizable within the desired dimension. In this paper we address these problems and develop a canonical model of RCC-8 which allows a simple representation of regions with respect to a set of RCC-8 constraints, and, further, enables us to generate realizations in any dimension d {$\geq$} 1. For threeand higher-dimensional space this can also be done for internally connected regions.},

Aspects of the model have been revised to align more closely with the IFLA LRM model, such as the handling of aggregation and representative expression attributes. Properties have been added to correspond to certain IFLA LRM relationships between works and expressions that were not declared in FRBRoo. The classes that represent the creation events of the main WEMI classes, F27 Work Creation and F28 Expression Creation, were revised. Specialized examples have been replaced with ones chosen to aid in comprehension of the model.},

This risk has been increasing under the impact of climate change, and in summer 2007 approximately 200,000 ha of vegetated land were burnt. The SEVIRI sensor, on board the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) geostationary satellite, is the only spaceborne sensor providing five and 15-minute observations of Europe in 12 spectral channels, including a short-wave infrared band sensitive to fire radiative temperature. In August 2007, when the bulk of the destructive wildfires started in Greece, the receiving station, operated by the Institute for Space Applications and Remote Sensing, provided us with a time series of MSG-SEVIRI images. These images were processed in order to test the reliability of a real-time detection and tracking system and its complementarity to conventional means provided by the Fire Brigade. EUMETSAT's Active Fire Monitoring (FIR) image processing algorithm for fire detection and monitoring was applied to SEVIRI data, then fine-tuned according to Greek conditions, and evaluated. Alarm announcements from the Fire Brigade's archives were used as ground truthing data in order to assess detection reliability and system performance. During the examined period, MSG-SEVIRI data successfully detected 82\% of the fire events in Greek territory with less than 1\% false alarms.},

  abstract = {Effective integration and wide sharing of geospatial data is an important and basic premise to facilitate the research and applications of geographic information science. However, the semantic heterogeneity of geospatial data is a major problem that significantly hinders geospatial data integration and sharing. Ontologies are regarded as a promising way to solve semantic problems by providing a formalized representation of geographic entities and relationships between them in a manner understandable to machines. Thus, many efforts have been made to explore ontology-based geospatial data integration and sharing. However, there is a lack of a specialized ontology that would provide a unified description for geospatial data. In this paper, with a focus on the characteristics of geospatial data, we propose a unified framework for geospatial data ontology, denoted GeoDataOnt, to establish a semantic foundation for geospatial data integration and sharing. First, we provide a characteristics hierarchy of geospatial data. Next, we analyze the semantic problems for each characteristic of geospatial data. Subsequently, we propose the general framework of GeoDataOnt, targeting these problems according to the characteristics of geospatial data. GeoDataOnt is then divided into multiple modules, and we show a detailed design and implementation for each module. Key limitations and challenges of GeoDataOnt are identified, and broad applications of GeoDataOnt are discussed.},

  abstract = {Geodesists work in Industry 4.0 and Spatial Information Management by using cross linked machines, people and data. Yet, one of the most popular technologies for interlinking data Semantic Web technologies - have been largely absent from the geodesy community, because of the slow development of standards, a mandatory non-trivial conversion between geospatial features and graph data, and a lack of commonly available GIS tools to achieve this. This is slowly changing due to an increased awareness of the advantages of Linked Data technology in the GIS community and an improvement of standards in the Semantic Web community. Hence, the importance of open source software, open geodata and open access increases. A fundamental requirement for data sharing is the use of standardised data models. In this paper we compare two different modelling approaches for Irish Ogham Stones as a best practice example for linked open data management: One approach uses Wikidata, and the other a custom ontology. While Wikidata offers direct integration into the Linked Open Data Cloud and needs less technological expertise, using a custom ontology enables the creation of best-fitting data models. Both approaches facilitate the use of new information sources for the geodesy community. We aim to demonstrate how Linked Open Geodata can be re-used and further enriched with information from other open sources such as spatial data from OpenStreetMap. For this purpose, we also present a QGIS plugin and a modified geospatial web service, as well as a geo-optimised Linked Data browser, as solutions for bridging the gap between geospatial features and Linked Open Data triples.},

The Simple Event Model (SEM) is created to model events in these various domains, without making assumptions about the domain-specific vocabularies used. SEM is designed with a minimum of semantic commitment to guarantee maximal interoperability. In this paper, we discuss the general requirements of an event model for web data and give examples from two use cases: historic events and events in the maritime safety and security domain. The advantages and disadvantages of several existing event models are discussed in the context of the historic example. We discuss the design decisions underlying SEM. SEM is coupled with a Prolog API that enables users to create instances of events without going into the details of the implementation of the model. By a tight coupling to existing Prolog packages, the API facilitates easy integration of event instances to Linked Open Data. We illustrate use of the API with examples from the maritime domain.},

  abstract = {The development of geographical information systems (GIS) and the interoperability between these systems demands new requirements for the description of the underlying data. The exchange of data between GIS systems is problematic and often fails due to confusion in the meaning of concepts. The term semantic translator, a translator between GIS systems and/or catalogue systems which gives the user the option to map data between the systems is a topic of current research. This paper provides an overview of formal ontologies and how they can be used for geographical information processing. A description of an intelligent broker architecture for semantic-based information retrieval is introduced, and shows how this approach can be used for general purposes. In conclusion we attempt to provide a roadmap for the use of ontologies for geographic information processing.},

  abstract = {Currently, a large amount of spatial and spatiotemporal RDF data has been shared and exchanged on the Internet and various applications. Resource Description Framework (RDF) is widely accepted for representing and processing data in different (including spatiotemporal) application domains. The effective management of spatial and spatiotemporal RDF data are becoming more and more important. A lot of work has been done to study how to represent, query, store, and manage spatial and spatiotemporal RDF data. In order to grasp and learn the main ideas and research results of spatial and spatiotemporal RDF data, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of RDF for spatial and spatiotemporal data management. We summarize spatial and spatiotemporal RDF data management from several essential aspects such as representation, querying, storage, performance assessment, datasets, and management tools. In addition, the direction of future research and some comparisons and analysis are also discussed in depth.},

  abstract = {In Semantic Web, modeling knowledge graph based on RDF becomes more and more popular. There is quite a lot of spatiotemporal information in Semantic Web, and recent works focus on not only general data but also spatiotemporal data. Existing efforts are mainly to add spatiotemporal labels to RDF, which expand RDF triple into quad or quintuple. However, extra labels often cause additional overhead for the system and lead to inefficient information organization management. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose an stRDFS model by labeling properties with spatiotemporal features and the corresponding determination methods of topological relations among different spatiotemporal entities. stRDFS considers spatiotemporal attribute as a part of the RDF model, which can record spatiotemporal information without changing the current RDF standard. Our approach improves the ability of recording and linking spatiotemporal data. More importantly, depending on formatting of spatiotemporal attributes in stRDFS, it will improve the semantic inferring ability, and the users are not required to be familiar with the underlying representations of spatiotemporal data.},
