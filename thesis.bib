Le memorie di un immigrato di origini friulane, lavoratore nell'ambito della bonifica pontina, fortunosamente pervenuteci, ci hanno fornito l'imperdibile occasione di calarci dal vivo nel passato e precisamente al momento della nascita di Pomezia, stavolta non attraverso le pagine dei giornali dell'epoca o dei libri di storia, oppure attraverso i fogli dei documenti ufficiali, ma direttamente con le suggestioni scaturite da pagine scarne ma sincere, essenziali e rare, come tutto quello che riporta la voce di chi allora non poteva testimoniare direttamente approvazioni o dissensi, impegnato com'era a risolvere il duro problema del vivere quotidiano ed era, oltre tutto, occhiutamente controllato da un regime totalitario che ne incanalava i moti e le reazioni. Le memorie di Romano Urbani ci parlano degli anni in cui non soltanto l'impeto della bonifica integrale in Agro Pontino ma anche l'esigenza di costruire in breve tempo nuove citt{\`a} di fondazione, fecero convergere in quell'area del Lazio numerose maestranze disponibili a lavorare sia nel campo agricolo che nell'edilizia.},

Discovering and linking this information poses eminent research challenges to the geospatial semantic web, with regards to the representation and manipulation of geographic data. Towards addressing these challenges, this work explores the potential of the current semantic web languages and tools. In particular, an integrated logical framework of rules and ontologies, using current W3C standards, is assessed for modeling geospatial ontologies of place encoding both symbolic and geometric references to place locations. Spatial reasoning is incorporated in the framework to facilitate the deduction of implicit semantics and for expressing spatial integrity constraints. The logical framework is then extended with geo-computation engines that offer more effective manipulations of geometric information. Example data sets mined from web resources are used to demonstrate and evaluate both frameworks, offering insights to their potentials and limitations.},

  abstract = {A decade in the life of an organization as dynamic and multifaceted as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration offers a large enough canvas to discern clearly the patterns and trends of the organization's life. For NASA, the decade which closed on October 1, 1968, was its first. That decade has been-and will continue to be-studied by many people and from many perspectives. It is with the hope of stimulating such studies that NASA is offering the NASA Historical Data Book, 1958-1968, of which this volume, NASA Resources, is the first. The intent of the series is to provide a comprehensive, factual data base on the tangible aspects of NASA and its programs. The first volume covers organization and management; the second will cover the individual space and aeronautics programs. This volume deals primarily with the resources which the Nation made available to NASA in that decade and traces the allocation of those resources. The perceptive eye will find much of NASA history and management philosophy, as well as many decisions, reflected in these columns of numbers. In the 1958-1961 period, there is evidence of the piecing together of a new agency to continue research in aeronautics while undertaking the leadership of the Nation's civilian space program. This involved the assimilating of organization, facilities, program, and people from a number of Government agencies and creating out of them a new organization and program. From 1961 to 1966, one can trace the national commitment to an expanded space program, expressed in the doubling and redoubling of resources and the growing momentum. In the 1967-1968 period, the lower costs mark the shift in the Apollo program from development and procurement into its operational phase. This was the decade in which the United States made its commitment to space exploration and demonstrated its capacity to achieve large and difficult goals in a sustained, orderly, and open program. From a historical point of view, in the short period of a decade, the exploration of the space frontier was generating a new Copernican Revolution in our perception of ourselves and our earth. The achievements in space sciences were sparking a rethinking of the educational curriculum. Communications and meteorological satellites progressed from experiment to global systems bringing important daily benefits to people on earth. Growing perception of this national capacity to mobilize, coupled with that other legacy from Apollo-the picture of our beautiful, fragile planet as "spaceship earth"-may in the long view of history rank as even more significant than its tremendous achievements in technology and science.},

  abstract = {Global market pressures and the rapid evolution of technologies and materials force manufacturers to constantly design, develop and produce new and varied products to maintain a competitive edge. Although virtual design and engineering tools have been key to supporting this fast rate of change, there remains a lack of seamless integration between and within tools across the domains of product, process, and resource design - especially to accommodate change. This research examines how changes to designs within these three domains can be captured and evaluated within a component based engineering tool (vueOne, developed by the Automation Systems Group at the University of Warwick). This paper describes how and where data within these tools can be mapped to quickly evaluate change (where typically a tedious process of data entry is required) decreasing lead times and cost and increasing productivity. The approach is tested on a sub-assembly of a hydrogen fuel cell, where an assembly system is modelled and changes are made to the sequence which is translated through to control logic. Although full implementation has not yet been realized, the concept has the potential to radically change the way changes are made and the approach can be extended to supporting other change types provided the appropriate rules and mapping.},

To address these issues, SILKNOW created a multilingual thesaurus related to silk textiles.

Archaeology would benefit from cultivating correspondence as a way to understand its research process. Ingold's model, however, appears to elide art and craft. Though both are necessary, I argue they should be kept separate for analytical purposes. Correspondence as pre-conceptual practice provides a way to understand that the form of archaeological objects is the outcome of processes of growth rather than design. Artworks as non-conceptual outcomes of practice provide insight into the nature of archaeological things beyond what can be understood under the general terms of correspondence. Artworks and archaeological things share the ontological problem of how to make something new out of materials. Artists work on materials to generate sensations never before experienced. Archaeologists work on a more circumscribed body of material to produce a past not thought of or experienced before. Unlike artworks, archaeological things carry both sensation and the residue of concepts with them. An archaeological sensibility can help archaeologists resurrect not the original concepts themselves but the conceptual potential immanent to the specific arrangements of materials and the forms they, however temporarily, take on.},

The semantic referee relies on ontological reasoning about spatial knowledge in order to characterize errors in terms of their spatial relations with the environment.

In this paper, the proposed method of the interaction between a neural network classifier and a semantic referee shows how to improve the performance of semantic segmentation for satellite imagery data.},

  abstract = {Knowledge elicitation is a process to obtain and transfer knowledge (that is, for example, accumulated inside the minds of experts in a certain domain) from humans to abstract and effective representations, to organize, model, and ultimately, communicate it in such form that is easier to understand and utilized through formal representation. Knowledge elicitation uses ontology approach so that knowledge representation can be presented in knowledge management system. This knowledge will be utilized mainly in Craft Convection Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Ontology as an instrument to represent knowledge has been studied and applied in various fields such as information science, knowledge engineering, artificial intelligence, or digital library. In the field of ontology and design, ontology can be applied in knowledge sharing. Using methontology approach, ontology modeling and implementation are developed to identify patterns and concepts of knowledge related to Craft Convection SMEs.},

  abstract = {Linked Open Data (LOD) is the largest, collaborative, distributed, and publicly-accessible Knowledge Graph (KG) uniformly encoded in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and formally represented according to the semantics of the Web Ontology Language (OWL). LOD provides researchers with a unique opportunity to study knowledge engineering as an empirical science: to observe existing modelling practices and possibly understanding how to improve knowledge engineering methodologies and knowledge representation formalisms. Following this perspective, several studies have analysed LOD to identify (mis-)use of OWL constructs or other modelling phenomena e.g. class or property usage, their alignment, the average depth of taxonomies. A question that remains open is whether there is a relation between observed modelling practices and knowledge domains (natural science, linguistics, etc.): do certain practices or phenomena change as the knowledge domain varies? Answering this question requires an assessment of the domains covered by LOD as well as a classification of its datasets. Existing approaches to classify LOD datasets provide partial and unaligned views, posing additional challenges. In this paper, we introduce a classification of knowledge domains, and a method for classifying LOD datasets and ontologies based on it. We classify a large portion of LOD and investigate whether a set of observed phenomena have a domain-specific character.},

The multiplicity of time in the mine involved the domination of time. With the technical recollection of previously learnt skills and especially through the acquisition of work experience handed down in the mines from one generation to the next, it was possible for the miners to defend themselves from total subjection to time imposed. Therefore breaking free from supervision, modifying the moment when the work is actually carried out, controlling the fatal time of the explosion of mines by successfully modifying the time factor, foreseeing and anticipating in time from a technical viewpoint the hazards of the rock and the death risks involved, they had a clear understanding of the rules and technical know-how, besides ethical features, which upheld the patterns of "man the worker" and "the good miner" achieved by the miners with time and through the partial yet concrete and significant domination of time.},

In this third edition, Bal updates the book to include more analysis of film narratives while also sharpening and tightening her language to make it the most readable and student-friendly edition to date. Bal also introduces new sections that treat and clarify several modernist texts that pose narratological challenges. With changes prompted by ten years of feedback from scholars and teachers, Narratology remains the most important contribution to the study of the way narratives work, are formed, and are received.},

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

Story maps are interactive online digital narratives that can describe a territory beyond its map by enriching the map with text, pictures, videos, and other multimedia information. This paper presents a semi-automatic workflow to produce story maps from textual documents containing territory data. An expert first assembles one territory-contextual document containing text and images. Then, automatic processes use natural language processing and Wikidata services to (i) extract key concepts (entities) and geospatial coordinates associated with the territory, (ii) assemble a logically-ordered sequence of enriched story-map events, and (iii) openly publish online story maps and an interoperable Linked Open Data semantic knowledge base for event exploration and inter-story correlation analyses. Our workflow uses an Open Science-oriented methodology to publish all processes and data. Through our workflow, we produced story maps for the value chains and territories of 23 rural European areas of 16 countries. Through numerical evaluation, we demonstrated that territory experts considered the story maps effective in describing their territories, and appropriate for communicating with citizens and stakeholders.},

  abstract = {Narratives play a crucial role in human communication, serving as a means to convey experiences, perspectives, and meanings across various domains. They are particularly significant in scientific communities, where narratives are often utilized to explain complex phenomena and share knowledge. This article explores the possibility of integrating large language models (LLMs) into a workflow that, exploiting the Semantic Web technologies, transforms raw textual data gathered by scientific communities into narratives. In particular, we focus on using LLMs to automatically create narrative events, maintaining the reliability of the generated texts. The study provides a conceptual definition of narrative events and evaluates the performance of different smaller LLMs compared to the requirements we identified. A key aspect of the experiment is the emphasis on maintaining the integrity of the original narratives in the LLM outputs, as experts often review texts produced by scientific communities to ensure their accuracy and reliability. We first perform an evaluation on a corpus of five narratives and then on a larger dataset comprising 124 narratives. LLaMA 2 is identified as the most suitable model for generating narrative events that closely align with the input texts, demonstrating its ability to generate high-quality narrative events. Prompt engineering techniques are then employed to enhance the performance of the selected model, leading to further improvements in the quality of the generated texts.},

  abstract = {The representation of temporal information has been in the center of intensive research activities over the years in the areas of knowledge representation, databases and more recently, the Semantic Web. The proposed approach extends the existing framework of representing temporal information in ontologies by allowing for representation of concepts evolving in time (referred to as ``dynamic'' information) and of their properties in terms of qualitative descriptions in addition to quantitative ones (i.e., dates, time instants and intervals). For this purpose, we advocate the use of natural language expressions, such as ``before'' or ``after'', for temporal entities whose exact durations or starting and ending points in time are unknown. Reasoning over all types of temporal information (such as the above) is also an important research problem. The current work addresses all these issues as follows: The representation of dynamic concepts is achieved using the ``4D-fluents'' or, alternatively, the ``N-ary relations'' mechanism. Both mechanisms are thoroughly explored and are expanded for representing qualitative and quantitative temporal information in OWL. In turn, temporal information is expressed using either intervals or time instants. Qualitative temporal information representation in particular, is realized using sets of SWRL rules and OWL axioms leading to a sound, complete and tractable reasoning procedure based on path consistency applied on the existing relation sets. Building upon existing Semantic Web standards (OWL), tools and member submissions (SWRL), as well as integrating temporal reasoning support into the proposed representation, are important design features of our approach.},

Without spatial reasoning, however, the value of this spatial context is limited. Over the past decade there have been several vocabularies and query languages that attempt to exploit this knowledge and enable spatial reasoning. These attempts provide varying levels of support for fundamental geospatial concepts. GeoSPARQL, a forthcoming OGC standard, attempts to unify data access for the geospatial SemanticWeb. As authors of the Parliament triple store and contributors to the GeoSPARQL specification, we are particularly interested in the issues of geospatial data access and indexing. In this paper, we look at the overall state of geospatial data in the Semantic Web, with a focus on GeoSPARQL. We first describe the motivation for GeoSPARQL, then the current state of the art in industry and research, followed by an example use case, and finally our implementation of GeoSPARQL in the Parliament triple store. {\copyright} 2009 - IOS Press and the authors.

Also, the representation ought to include how agents should carry out the actions associated with the process, whether or not agents are able to perform those actions, the possible roles played as well as the related events. The OASIS ontology provides an established model to capture agents and their interactions but lacks means for representing processes and procedures carried out by agents. This motivates the research presented in this article, which delivers an extension of the OASIS 2 ontology to combine the capabilities for representing agents and their behaviours with the full conceptualization of processes and procedures. The overarching goal is to deliver a foundational OWL ontology that deals with agent planning, reaching a balance between generality and applicability, which is known to be an open challenge.},

The current study examined the link between narcissism and both SNS activities and motivation for SNSs activities. Results indicated that narcissism did not relate to the amount of time spent on SNS, frequency of status updates, posting picture of others, or checking up on SNS friends. However, narcissism predicted reasons why Millennials use SNSs, such as having as many SNS friends as possible, wanting their SNS friends to know what they were doing, believing their SNS friends were interested in what they are doing, and having their SNS profiles project a positive image. Findings suggest that Millennials' general usage of SNSs is a sign of the times. While narcissists in the Millennial generation do not appear to use SNSs more often than non-narcissists, their reasons for doing so are different.},

  abstract = {Social media enabled a direct path from producer to consumer of contents changing the way users get informed, debate, and shape their worldviews. Such a disintermediation might weaken consensus on social relevant issues in favor of rumors, mistrust, or conspiracy thinking---e.g., chem-trails inducing global warming, the link between vaccines and autism, or the New World Order conspiracy. Previous studies pointed out that consumers of conspiracy-like content are likely to aggregate in homophile clusters---i.e., echo-chambers. Along this path we study, by means of a thorough quantitative analysis, how different topics are consumed inside the conspiracy echo-chamber in the Italian Facebook. Through a semi-automatic topic extraction strategy, we show that the most consumed contents semantically refer to four specific categories: environment, diet, health, and geopolitics. We find similar consumption patterns by comparing users activity (likes and comments) on posts belonging to these different semantic categories. Finally, we model users mobility across the distinct topics finding that the more a user is active, the more he is likely to span on all categories. Once inside a conspiracy narrative users tend to embrace the overall corpus.},

This paper investigates the extent of geospatial knowledge, awareness, and reasoning abilities encoded within such pretrained LLMs. With a focus on autoregressive language models, we devise experimental approaches related to (i) probing LLMs for geo-coordinates to assess geospatial knowledge, (ii) using geospatial and non-geospatial prepositions to gauge their geospatial awareness, and (iii) utilizing a multidimensional scaling (MDS) experiment to assess the models' geospatial reasoning capabilities and to determine locations of cities based on prompting. Our results confirm that it does not only take larger but also more sophisticated LLMs to synthesize geospatial knowledge from textual information. As such, this research contributes to understanding the potential and limitations of LLMs in dealing with geospatial information.},

In this work, we follow the latter approach, by identifying the syntactic differences that a fuzzy ontology language has to cope with, and by proposing a concrete methodology to represent fuzzy ontologies using OWL 2 annotation properties. We also report on some prototypical implementations: a plug-in to edit fuzzy ontologies using OWL 2 annotations and some parsers that translate fuzzy ontologies represented using our methodology into the languages supported by some reasoners.},

  abstract = {This chapter illustrates ontological systems, hereafter referred to as ontologies, which satisfy the two main requirements of being formal and foundational. Ontology is formal if it is expressed in a logic language endowed with clear semantics (for instance, in model-theoretic terms as first-order predicate logic). This choice is not determined by application concerns (at least, not primarily), it emphasizes the relevance that semantic transparency has in this domain. By foundational ontologies one means those knowledge systems that focus on very general and basic concepts (like object, event, state, quality) and relations (such as constitution, participation, dependence, parthood). Often, the term formal ontology is used to cover both the requirements, thus reminding us of Husserl's distinction between formal logic and formal ontology. In this specific meaning, formal ontology is the study of the interconnections between entities, properties, parts, wholes and collectives. These are considered to be ``formal'' because they can be exemplified by objects in all domains of reality. To take another perspective, one can say that formal ontology is the study of formal (logical) systems which are: general, since they include the most usable and widely applicable concepts; reliable, as they are logical theories with clear semantics, a rich axiomatization and carefully analyzed formal consequences (theorems); and well organized, because they are based on philosophical principles the choice of which is explicitly motivated and remains independent from particular domains.},

An ontology is commonly used as a structure capturing knowledge about a certain area by providing relevant concepts and relations between them. Analysis of textual data plays an important role in construction and usage of ontologies, especially with the growing popularity of semi-automated ontology construction (here referred to also as ontology learning). Different knowledge discovery methods have been adopted for the problem of semi-automated ontology construction [10] including unsupervised, semi-supervised and supervised learning over a collection of text documents, using natural language processing to obtain semantic graph of a document, visualization of documents, information extraction to find relevant concepts, visualization of context of named entities in a document collection.},

Also, RDF can easily represent spatial relationships, as long as the location information is symbolic, i.e., represented by places that have a name. What is widely missing is support for geographic and geometric information, such as coordinates or spatial polygons, which is needed in many applications that deal with sensor data or map data. This calls for efficient data management systems which are capable of querying large amounts of RDF data and support spatial query predicates. We present a native RDF triple store implementation with deeply integrated spatial query functionality. We model spatial features in RDF as literals of a complex geometry type and express spatial predicates as SPARQL filter functions on this type. This makes it possible to use W3C's standardized SPARQL query language as-is, i.e., without any modifications or extensions for spatial queries. We evaluate the characteristics of our system on very large data volumes.},

The workers develop a fatalistic attitude to the existing hazards, which are perceived as structural, while the risk of contracting diseases or suffering injuries has a random outcome. The different interpretation of health or disease experiences and the management of occupational risks intensifies the critical point formed by the deep underlying problem of the relationship between Italian and foreign workers.

We build a unique dataset combining all the online content produced by French news media during the year 2013 with new micro audience data. We develop a topic detection algorithm that identifies each news event, trace the timeline of each story, and study news propagation. We unravel new evidence on online news production. First, we document high reactivity of online media: one quarter of the news stories are reproduced online in under 4 minutes. Second, we show that this comes with extensive copying: only 33\% of the online content is original. Third, we investigate the cost of copying for original news producers. Using article-level variations and media-level daily audience combined with article-level social media statistics, we find that readers partly switch to the original producers, thereby mitigating the newsgathering incentive problem raised by copying.},

  abstract = {Formal ontologies have proved to be a very useful tool to manage interoperability among data, systems and knowledge. In this paper we will show how formal ontologies can evolve from a crisp, deterministic framework (ontologies of hard knowledge) to new probabilistic, fuzzy or possibilistic frameworks (ontologies of soft knowledge). This can considerably enlarge the application potential of formal ontologies in geographic analysis and planning, where soft knowledge is intrinsically linked to the complexity of the phenomena under study. The paper briefly presents these new uncertainty-based formal ontologies. It then highlights how ontologies are formal tools to define both concepts and relations among concepts. An example from the domain of urban geography finally shows how the cause-to-effect relation between household preferences and urban sprawl can be encoded within a crisp, a probabilistic and a possibilistic ontology, respectively. The ontology formalism will also determine the kind of reasoning that can be developed from available knowledge. Uncertain ontologies can be seen as the preliminary phase of more complex uncertainty-based models. The advantages of moving to uncertainty-based models is evident: whether it is in the analysis of geographic space or in decision support for planning, reasoning on geographic space is almost always reasoning with uncertain knowledge of geographic phenomena.},

In particular, we consider processes executed over a relational database which issue calls to external services to acquire new information and update the data.We equip these processes with an OBDA system, in which an ontology modeling the domain of interest is connected through declarative mappings to the database, and that consequently allows one to understand and govern the manipulated information at the conceptual level. In this setting, we are interested in verifying first-order {$\mu$}-calculus formulae specifying temporal properties over the evolution of the information at the conceptual level. Specifically, we show how, building on first-order rewritability of queries over the system state that is typical of OBDA, we are able to reformulate the temporal properties into temporal properties expressed over the underlying database. This allows us to adopt notable decidability results on verification of evolving databases that have been established recently.},

  abstract = {The paper proposes a process-based model for an ontology that encompasses the emergence of process systems generated by increasingly complex levels of organization. Starting with a division of processes into those that are persistent and those that are fleeting, the model builds through a series of exclusive and exhaustive disjunctions. The crucial distinction is between those persistent and cohesive systems that are energy wells, and those that are far-from-equilibrium. The latter are necessarily open; they can persist only by interaction with their environments. Further distinctions, developed by means of the notions of self-maintenance and error detection, lead to the identification of complex biological organisms that are flexible learners, some of which are self-conscious and form themselves into social institutions. This model provides a non-reductive model for understanding human beings as both embodied and yet emergent. In particular, it provides a way of characterizing action as `metaphysically deep', not an ontological embarrassment within an otherwise physicalist world.},

As clickbaits often use eye-catching wording to attract viewers, target contents are often of low quality. Clickbaits are especially widespread on social media such as Twitter, adversely impacting user experience by causing immense dissatisfaction. Hence, it has become increasingly important to put forward a widely applicable approach to identify and detect clickbaits. In this paper, we make use of a dataset from the clickbait challenge 2017 (clickbait-challenge.com) comprising of over 21,000 headlines/titles, each of which is annotated by at least five judgments from crowdsourcing on how clickbait it is. We attempt to build an effective computational clickbait detection model on this dataset. We first considered a total of 331 features, filtered out many features to avoid overfitting and improve the running time of learning, and eventually selected the 60 most important features for our final model. Using these features, Random Forest Regression achieved the following results: MSE=0.035 MSE, Accuracy=0.82, and F1-sore=0.61 on the clickbait class.},

  abstract = {Process industry enterprises rely heavily on expert experience in production, and expert knowledge is stored in multiple formats like, pictures, texts, videos, etc. Several isolated islands of information or knowledge are formed, and they are difficult to store, share, and expand upon. Therefore, the same procedure appears multiple times in different application scenarios, such as optimization scheduling, optimization operation, or fault diagnosis. If redundant knowledge is paid too much attention, decision-makers will not be able to comprehensively consider business knowledge. Thus, a novel framework is proposed for the process industry to manage procedure knowledge. This paper first divides the detailed procedure of process plants into four layers, that is, raw materials, intermediate materials, operation, and products based on the P-graph theory, which involves virtual hierarchies, nodes, and operations. Second, the domain ontology-based procedure knowledge model is constructed. Finally, two experimental cases, the Tennessee Eastman (TE) and the ethylene production process, are studied to verify the procedure knowledge framework (PKF). The PKF provides a useful foundation for the subsequent construction of a superstructure model based on the P-graph theory and is different from the previous industrial process industrial ontology model. The PKF has a theoretical basis for simulation calculation and makes future work based on PKF more accurate and interpretable.},

In the 8+ years since its publication, GeoSPARQL has become the most important spatial Semantic Web standard, as judged by references to it in other Semantic Web standards and its wide use for Semantic Web data. An update to GeoSPARQL was proposed in 2019 to deliver a version 1.1 with a charter to: handle outstanding change requests and source new ones from the user community and to ``better present'' the standard, that is to better link all the standard's parts and better document and exemplify elements. Expected updates included new geometry representations, alignments to other ontologies, handling of new spatial referencing systems, and new artifact presentation. This paper describes motivating change requests and actual resultant updates in the candidate version 1.1 of the standard alongside reference implementations and usage examples. We also describe the theory behind particular updates, initial implementations of many parts of the standard, and our expectations for GeoSPARQL 1.1's use.},

  abstract = {More and better information is often seen as a prerequisite for better management practices. It is the task of information systems to collect or create such information. These simple premises are problematic, however. One of the reasons for this is that the very concept of information is not clear. This paper discusses the notion of information as well as the apparently opposing notions of misinformation and disinformation from a critical research perspective. Starting with a discussion of the question of truth, the paper argues that there is no agreement on what truth is and, therefore, what information is. The critical approach provides a different way of understanding these issues. Critical research aims to change the status quo and lead to emancipation. Drawing on two of the most prominent theoreticians of critical research, J{\"u}rgen Habermas and Michel Foucault, the paper explores what truth and information can mean for critical research. The contribution of the paper is to extend the debate on information and truth beyond its typical confines and show to the researcher that these issues are not value-neutral; every commitment to a research approach is a value choice that the researcher makes and needs to reflect on.},

The authors test whether this ``strength of weak ties'' generalizes from simple to complex contagions. Complex contagions require social affirmation from multiple sources. Examples include the spread of high-risk social movements, avant garde fashions, and unproven technologies. Results show that as adoption thresholds increase, long ties can impede diffusion. Complex contagions depend primarily on the width of the bridges across a network, not just their length. Wide bridges are a characteristic feature of many spatial networks, which may account in part for the widely observed tendency for social movements to diffuse spatially.},

A popular hypothesis states that networks with many clustered ties and a high degree of separation will be less effective for behavioral diffusion than networks in which locally redundant ties are rewired to provide shortcuts across the social space. A competing hypothesis argues that when behaviors require social reinforcement, a network with more clustering may be more advantageous, even if the network as a whole has a larger diameter. I investigated the effects of network structure on diffusion by studying the spread of health behavior through artificially structured online communities. Individual adoption was much more likely when participants received social reinforcement from multiple neighbors in the social network. The behavior spread farther and faster across clustered-lattice networks than across corresponding random networks. An online experiment shows how network structure affects the spread of health behavior. An online experiment shows how network structure affects the spread of health behavior.},

  abstract = {Most of the online news media outlets rely heavily on the revenues generated from the clicks made by their readers, and due to the presence of numerous such outlets, they need to compete with each other for reader attention. To attract the readers to click on an article and subsequently visit the media site, the outlets often come up with catchy headlines accompanying the article links, which lure the readers to click on the link. Such headlines are known as Clickbaits. While these baits may trick the readers into clicking, in the long run, clickbaits usually don't live up to the expectation of the readers, and leave them disappointed. In this work, we attempt to automatically detect clickbaits and then build a browser extension which warns the readers of different media sites about the possibility of being baited by such headlines. The extension also offers each reader an option to block clickbaits she doesn't want to see. Then, using such reader choices, the extension automatically blocks similar clickbaits during her future visits. We run extensive offline and online experiments across multiple media sites and find that the proposed clickbait detection and the personalized blocking approaches perform very well achieving 93\% accuracy in detecting and 89\% accuracy in blocking clickbaits.},

A review of their historical development and recent outbreaks leads to a number of observations. First, while viruses were more common than worms initially, worms have become the predominant threat in recent years, coinciding with the growth of computer networking. Second, despite widespread use of firewalls and other network security equipment, worm outbreaks still occur and will likely continue to be a threat for the near future. Third, recent worms are appearing as a series of quick successive variants. Unlike the independent efforts of early viruses, these variants suggest an increasing level of coordination among worm creators. Fourth, recent worms have shown capabilities to spread faster and exploit more infection vectors. This trend implies a more urgent need for automated, coordinated protection measures. Finally, more dangerous payloads are becoming commonplace. This suggests that worm creators are using worms for other objectives than simply infection, such as data theft and setting up denial of service networks.},

All of the letters are in lower case. 7. There are no double consonants. 8. It includes diphthong, triphthongs, quadriphthongs and even quintiphthongs for the abbreviation of phonetic components. 9. It includes some words and abbreviations in Latin. As a result, identifying the language and solving the writing system required some ingenuity and lateral thinking, but both were duly revealed. The writing system is rather more singular and less intuitive than modern systems, which may explain why it failed to become culturally ubiquitous and ultimately became obsolete. On the other hand, a significant vestige of the language has survived into the modern era, because its lexicon has been sequestered into the many modern languages of Mediterranean Europe. Here, the language and writing system are explained, so that other scholars can explore the manuscript for its linguistic and informative content.},

Dall'analisi si evince un netto ritardo dell'Italia rispetto alla media europea, sia per quanto concerne il tasso di penetrazione sia per l'ampiezza media effettiva della banda erogata. Le determinanti del ritardo appaiono riconducibili a problemi culturali, orografici e strategici (legati, questi ultimi, alla struttura del mercato e agli ostacoli burocratici alla realizzazione di infrastrutture). Si presentano infine gli interventi regolamentari a sostegno della diffusione della banda larga e si offrono alcune indicazioni volte a migliorare la qualit{\`a} del servizio e a ridurre il divario digitale.},

Building on the semiotic and structuralist narratology, and on the work carried out in the late 1980s by Giuseppe Gigliozzi in Italy, the focus of my research are the concepts of character and of narrative world/space. This formal model is expressed in the OWL 2 ontology language. The main reason to adopt a formal modeling approach is that I consider the purely probabilistic-quantitative methods (now widespread in digital literary studies) inadequate. An ontology, on one hand provides a tool for the analysis of strictly literary texts. On the other hand (though beyond the scope of the present work), its formalization can also represent a significant contribution towards grounding the application of storytelling methods outside of scholarly contexts.DOI:~http://dx.doi.org/10.14195/2182-8830\_4-1\_2},

A difficult task is to assign precise semantics to user queries involving concepts such as ``crosses'', ``is inside'', ``is adjacent''. In this paper, we present two methods for describing topological relationships. The first method is an extension of the geometric point-set approach by taking the dimension of the intersections into account. This results in a very large number of different topological relationships for point, line, and area features. In the second method, which aims to be more suitable for humans, we propose to group all possible cases into a few meaningful topological relationships and we discuss their exclusiveness and completeness with respect to the point-set approach.},

The need for spatial representations and spatial reasoning is ubiquitous in artificial intelligence (AI) from robot planning and navigation to interpreting visual inputs to understanding natural language. In all these cases, the need to represent and reason about spatial aspects of the world is of key importance. Related fields of research such as geographic information science (GIScience) have also driven the spatial representation and reasoning community to produce efficient, expressive, and useful calculi. There has been considerable research in spatial representations that are based on metric measurements, in particular within the vision and robotics communities, and also on raster and vector representations in GIScience. This chapter focuses on symbolic and, in particular, qualitative representations. The challenge of qualitative spatial reasoning (QSR) is to provide calculi that allow a machine to represent and reason with spatial entities without resort to the traditional quantitative techniques prevalent in, for example, computer graphics or computer vision communities.},

  abstract = {Increasing the expressiveness of qualitative spatial calculi is an essential step towards meeting the requirements of applications. This can be achieved by combining existing calculi in a way that we can express spatial information using relations from multiple calculi. The great challenge is to develop reasoning algorithms that are correct and complete when reasoning over the combined information. Previous work has mainly studied cases where the interaction between the combined calculi was small, or where one of the two calculi was very simple. In this paper we tackle the important combination of topological and directional information for extended spatial objects. We combine some of the best known calculi in qualitative spatial reasoning, the RCC8 algebra for representing topological information, and the Rectangle Algebra (RA) and the Cardinal Direction Calculus (CDC) for directional information. We consider two different interpretations of the RCC8 algebra, one uses a weak connectedness relation, the other uses a strong connectedness relation. In both interpretations, we show that reasoning with topological and directional information is decidable and remains in NP. Our computational complexity results unveil the significant differences between RA and CDC, and that between weak and strong RCC8 models. Take the combination of basic RCC8 and basic CDC constraints as an example: we show that the consistency problem is in P only when we use the strong RCC8 algebra and explicitly know the corresponding basic RA constraints.},

  abstract = {Extending business processes with semantic annotations has gained recent attention. This comprises relating process elements to ontology elements in order to create a shared conceptual and terminological understanding. In business process modeling, processes may have to adhere to a multitude of rules. A common way to detect compliance automatedly is studying the artifact of the process model itself. However, if an ontology exists as an additional artifact, it may prove beneficial to exploit this structure for compliance detection, as it provides a rich specification of the business process. We therefore propose an approach that models a rules-layer ontop of an ontology. Said rules-layer is implemented by a logic program and can be used to reason about the compliance of an underlying ontology. Our approach allows ad-hoc access to external ontologies, other than similar approaches that are reliant on a redundant logical representation of process model elements.},

Many works have studied OBPM and are clear on the potential amenities, such as eliminating ambiguities or enabling advanced reasoning over company processes. However, despite this approval in academia, a widespread industry adoption is still nowhere to be seen. This can be mainly attributed to the fact, that it still requires high amounts of manual labour to initially create ontologies and annotations to process models. As long as these problems are not addressed, implementing OBPM seems unfeasible in practice. In this work, we therefore identify requirements needed for a successful implementation of OBPM and assess the current state of research w.r.t. these requirements. Our results indicate that the research progress for means to facilitate OBPM are still alarmingly low and there needs to be urgent work on extending existing approaches.},

After laying out the fundamental ideas behind interactive storytelling and explaining some of the misconceptions that have crippled past efforts, the book delves into all the major systems that go into interactive storytelling: personality models, actors, props, stages, fate, verbs, history books, and more. Crawford also covers the Storytron technology he has been working on for several years, an engine that runs interactive electonic storyworlds, giving readers a first-hand look into practical storytelling methods.},

MITECS lacks entries for NARRATIVE or STORY, and more generally the text omits discussion of many narrative-pertinent concepts that promise to throw light on key research questions in cognitive science. My essay thus uses MITECS as a vehicle for opening new lines of communication between areas of research that stand to gain from being brought into a closer, more synergistic relation with one another. More than this, the essay makes the stronger claim that narrative theory should be viewed as a subdomain of the cognitive sciences.}

The CIDOC CRM is now in the process to become an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard. This article justifies in detail the methodology and design by functional requirements and gives examples of its contents. The CIDOC CRM analyzes the common conceptualizations behind data and metadata structures to support data transformation, mediation, and merging. It is argued that such ontologies are propertycentric, in contrast to terminological systems, and should be built with different methodologies. It is demonstrated that ontological and epistemological arguments are equally important for an effective design, in particular when dealing with knowledge from the past in any domain. It is assumed that the presented methodology and the upper level of the ontology are applicable in a far wider domain.},

  journal = {TECHNICAL REPORT},
  abstract = {There is a rising interest to enrich cultural heritage data with precise and well identified descriptions of location and geometry of sites of historical events or remains, objects and natural features. The ``geospatial community'' and the ``cultural heritage community'' have developed standards reflecting different foci -- the OGC/ISO Standards for Geographic Information and the ontology of the CIDOC CRM which is the ISO standard for representing cultural heritage information. This report introduces the CRMgeo extension for the CIDOC CRM to provide an ``articulation'' (linkage) between the standards of the geospatial and the cultural heritage community in particular between GeoSPARQL and CIDOC CRM. The model was developed from the analysis of the epistemological processes of defining, using and determining places. This means that we analyzed how a question, such as ``is this the place of the Varus Battle'' or ``is this the place where Lord Nelson died'', can be verified or falsified, including geometric specifications. Consequently, we reached at a detailed model which seems to give a complete account of all practical components necessary to verify such a question, in agreement with the laws of physics, the practice of geometric measurement and archaeological reasoning. This model indeed appears to have the capability to link both ontologies and shows the way how to correctly reconcile data at any scale and time -- not by inventing precision or truth that cannot be acquired, but by quantifying or delimiting the inherent indeterminacies, as it is good practice in natural sciences. This model aims at being a comprehensive theory from which mutually compatible simplification can be derived for implementations in more constraint environment, such at those lacking moving frames.},

These systems work well when documents are clearly relevant to a question context. But what about when a document has partial information, or less obvious connections to the context? And how should we reason about connections between documents? In this work, we seek to answer these two core questions about RAG generation. We introduce G-RAG, a reranker based on graph neural networks (GNNs) between the retriever and reader in RAG. Our method combines both connections between documents and semantic information (via Abstract Meaning Representation graphs) to provide a context-informed ranker for RAG. G-RAG outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while having smaller computational footprint. Additionally, we assess the performance of PaLM 2 as a reranker and find it to significantly underperform G-RAG. This result emphasizes the importance of reranking for RAG even when using Large Language Models.},

The function of gazetteers is to obtain descriptions uniquely identifying places referred to in discourse. Often, they are lists of places containing place name, feature type and geographical extent. Contemporary digital gazetteers (e.g. World Historical Gazetteer and Pleiades) are valuable tools for geographical knowledge of the past and the structuring of humanities data. However, scholars and GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) specialists often require information about entities on an intra-city scale. This presentation explores the model and implementation of an urban gazetteer using CIDOC CRM as a top-level ontology. The model will closely follow international gazetteer standards (i.e. Linked Places Format) in order to ensure interoperability with other gazetteer datasets. To move towards a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) approach, humanities data from the urban gazetteer will be published as Linked Open Data (LOD) and searchable via (Geo)SPARQL.},

Terms like close and far or North and South are not as clearly understood as the standard relationships between integer numbers. The treatment of relationships among spatial objects is an essential task in geographic data processing and CAD/CAM. Spatial query languages, for example, must offer terms for spatial relationships; spatial database management systems need algorithms to determine relationships. Hence, a formal definition of spatial relationships is necessary to clarify the users' diverse understanding of spatial relationships and to actually deduce relationships among spatial objects. Based upon such formalisms, spatial reasoning and inference will be possible.},

  abstract = {What is the impact of information and communication technologies (ICTs) on the human condition? In order to address this question, in 2012 the European Commission organized a research project entitled The Onlife Initiative: concept reengineering for rethinking societal concerns in the digital transition. This volume collects the work of the Onlife Initiative. It explores how the development and widespread use of ICTs have a radical impact on the human condition.ICTs are not mere tools but rather social forces that are increasingly affecting our self-conception (who we are), our mutual interactions (how we socialise); our conception of reality (our metaphysics); and our interactions with reality (our agency). In each case, ICTs have a huge ethical, legal, and political significance, yet one with which we have begun to come to terms only recently.The impact exercised by ICTs is due to at least four major transformations: the blurring of the distinction between reality and virtuality; the blurring of the distinction between human, machine and nature; the reversal from information scarcity to information abundance; and the shift from the primacy of stand-alone things, properties, and binary relations, to the primacy of interactions, processes and networks.Such transformations are testing the foundations of our conceptual frameworks. Our current conceptual toolbox is no longer fitted to address new ICT-related challenges. This is not only a problem in itself. It is also a risk, because the lack of a clear understanding of our present time may easily lead to negative projections about the future. The goal of The Manifesto, and of the whole book that contextualises, is therefore that of contributing to the update of our philosophy. It is a constructive goal. The book is meant to be a positive contribution to rethinking the philosophy on which policies are built in a hyperconnected world, so that we may have a better chance of understanding our ICT-related problems and solving them satisfactorily.The Manifesto launches an open debate on the impacts of ICTs on public spaces, politics and societal expectations toward policymaking in the Digital Agenda for Europe's remit. More broadly, it helps start a reflection on the way in which a hyperconnected world calls for rethinking the referential frameworks on which policies are built.},

Various Wikipedia researchers have commended Wikidata for its collaborative nature and liberatory potential, yet less attention has been paid to the social and political implications of Wikidata. This article aims to advance work in this context by introducing the concept of semantic infrastructure and outlining how Wikidata's role as semantic infrastructure is the primary vehicle by which Wikipedia has become infrastructural for digital platforms. We develop two key themes that build on questions of power that arise in infrastructure studies and apply to Wikidata: knowledge representation and data labor. We argue that considering these issues about Wikidata helps contextualize such infrastructural technologies within existing media and communication studies debates and highlights the contingencies upon which their outcomes depend.},

  abstract = {The problem of concept representation is relevant for many subfields of cognitive research, including psychology and philosophy, as well as artificial intelligence. In particular, in recent years it has received a great deal of attention within the field of knowledge representation, due to its relevance for both knowledge engineering as well as ontology-based technologies. However, the notion of a concept itself turns out to be highly disputed and problematic. In our opinion, one of the causes of this state of affairs is that the notion of a concept is, to some extent, heterogeneous, and encompasses different cognitive phenomena. This results in a strain between conflicting requirements, such as compositionality, on the one hand and the need to represent prototypical information on the other. In some ways artificial intelligence research shows traces of this situation. In this paper, we propose an analysis of this current state of affairs. Since it is our opinion that a mature methodology with which to approach knowledge representation and knowledge engineering should also take advantage of the empirical results of cognitive psychology concerning human abilities, we outline some proposals for concept representation in formal ontologies, which take into account suggestions from psychological research. Our basic assumption is that knowledge representation systems whose design takes into account evidence from experimental psychology (and which, therefore, are more similar to the human way of organizing and processing information) may therefore give better results in many applications (e.g. in the fields of information retrieval and semantic web).},

Instead of trying to treat them as entities all on a similar footing, as most previous  authors have done, we regard processes as abstract patterns of behaviour which may be realised  in concrete form as actually occurring states or events. Processes are divided into two broad  types, called continuables and repeatables, and various mappings between and within these  categories are considered.

  abstract = {Purpose The development of common ontologies has recently been identified as one of the key challenges in the emerging field of surgical data science (SDS). However, past and existing initiatives in the domain of surgery have mainly been focussing on individual groups and failed to achieve widespread international acceptance by the research community. To address this challenge, the authors of this paper launched a European initiative---OntoSPM Collaborative Action---with the goal of establishing a framework for joint development of ontologies in the field of SDS. This manuscript summarizes the goals and the current status of the international initiative. Methods A workshop was organized in 2016, gathering the main European research groups having experience in developing and using ontologies in this domain. It led to the conclusion that a common ontology for surgical process models (SPM) was absolutely needed, and that the existing OntoSPM ontology could provide a good starting point toward the collaborative design and promotion of common, standard ontologies on SPM. Results The workshop led to the OntoSPM Collaborative Action---launched in mid-2016---with the objective to develop, maintain and promote the use of common ontologies of SPM relevant to the whole domain of SDS. The fundamental concept, the architecture, the management and curation of the common ontology have been established, making it ready for wider public use. Conclusion The OntoSPM Collaborative Action has been in operation for 24 months, with a growing dedicated membership. Its main result is a modular ontology, undergoing constant updates and extensions, based on the experts' suggestions. It remains an open collaborative action, which always welcomes new contributors and applications.},

  abstract = {This article explores the historic--geographic evolution of contemporary craft production, with sensitivity to materiality of labor process, product design, and accompanying place mythologies. Craft production---increasingly interpolated as a form of creative work---is shaped by concerns about retrieving archaic tools and ways of making things, celebrating provenance and the haptic skills of makers, and delivering (and marketing) manual labor process. In contrast to evolutionary economic geography's seeming immateriality and abstraction, attention is drawn to material aspects of place and path dependence that undergird geographies of new craft industries: how labor process evolves, in iteration with technical lock-ins that stem from production method, product design, and capacities of component materials, but also how legacies of mass manufacturing linger in putatively authentic places---shaping new geographic concentrations. An especially vivid case is explored: a cluster of cowboy bootmaking workshops in El Paso, Texas. Bootmaking has metamorphosed from artisanal to factory to a craft-based creative mode of production. Crucial were continuity in product design and evolution of labor process. So, too, was geography: an iconic borderland city location with historic legacies of labor intensive mass manufacturing; migrant workers with requisite embodied skills; antique tools; and significant stocks of leather, the core input material that must be seen, felt, and smelt by makers before fabrication. I argue for a grounded, critical evolutionary economic geography that requires stronger intersection with labor process, with the cultural logics infusing capitalism, and with greater recognition of material inheritances that are reconfigured in place over successive generations.},

Apart from the standard OWL 2 reasoning task of entailment checking, HermiT supports several specialised reasoning services such as class and property classification, as well as a range of features outside the OWL 2 standard such as DL-safe rules, SPARQL queries, and description graphs. We discuss the system's architecture, and we present an overview of the techniques used to support the mentioned reasoning tasks.

  abstract = {A hazard is a natural occurrence that might harm humans, animals or the environment. It may cause loss of life, illness or other health consequences, property damage, social and economic crisis or environmental degradation. Many places of the world are at risk from one or more disasters. Although many studies have concentrated on single hazards, there is a need for integrated evaluations of multi-hazards for more effective land management. A selection of datasets and methods, such as meteorological data, satellite images, and GIS, were used to create the risk assessment maps. The parameters for multi-hazard assessment are mainly considered as rainfall, slope, elevation, and land use/land cover and create a map in a GIS environment. For a particular region, multi-hazards can be produced by integrating maps of several hazard assessments. The objective of this study is an integration of geospatial and fuzzy-logic techniques for multi-hazard mapping. Extensive parts of Gujarat state (India) experience a wide range of natural hazards: floods, soil erosion, drought, and earthquakes. This research creates and evaluates individual and group multi-hazard maps to visualize the spatial variation of hazards in Gujarat state, India. The calculated four individual hazard maps have been categorised into five classes: very-low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The multi hazard map has been classified into sixteen classes using the GIS unsupervised. This study aims to improve disaster preparedness, enhance land management, or guide decision-making for disaster risk reduction. This study can be helpful in the future to engineers, planners, and local governments in the field of spatial planning and natural disaster management.},

In order to formalize these tasks as reasoning problems, we introduce the notions of conservative extension, safety and module for a very general class of logic-based ontology languages. We investigate the general properties of and relationships between these notions  and study the relationships between the relevant reasoning problems we have previously identified. To study the computability of these problems, we   consider, in particular, Description Logics (DLs), which provide the formal underpinning of the W3C Web Ontology Language (OWL), and show that all the  problems we consider are undecidable or algorithmically unsolvable for the description logic underlying OWL DL.  In order to achieve a practical solution, we identify conditions sufficient for an ontology to reuse a set of symbols ``safely''---that is, without changing their meaning. We provide the notion of a safety class, which characterizes any sufficient condition for safety, and identify a family of safety classes--called locality---which enjoys a collection of desirable properties.  We use the notion of a safety class to extract modules from ontologies, and we provide various modularization algorithms that are appropriate to the properties of the particular safety class in use.  Finally, we show practical benefits of our safety checking and module extraction algorithms.},

To this aim we tightly integrate process models with a domain ontology and an activity ontology, so providing a semantic vision of the application context and of the processes themselves. Moreover, the framework is equipped with a set of techniques providing for advanced functionalities, which can be very useful when building and analyzing process models, such as consistency checking, interactive ontology navigation, automatic (re)discovering of process models. A software architecture fully supporting our framework is also presented and discussed.},

In this paper we study the computational problems involved in developing such an inference system. We point out that the problem has two distinct components that interact in rather complex ways: relational consistency, and planarity. We develop polynomial-time algorithms for several important special cases, and prove almost all the others to be NP-hard. 1},

Every user task, entity, attribute and relationship from the original three models was examined, definitions had to be revised, but also some remodelling was required in order to develop a meaningful consolidation. The result is a single, streamlined, and logically consistent model that covers all aspects of bibliographic data and that at the same time brings the modelling up-to-date with current conceptual modelling practices. IFLA LRM was designed to be used in linked data environments and to support and promote the use of bibliographic data in linked data environments.},

  abstract = {In a number of papers, Kit Fine introduced a theory of embodiment which distinguishes between rigid and variable embodiments, and has been successfully applied to clarify the ontological nature of entities whose parts may or may not vary in time. In particular, he has applied this theory to describe a process such as the erosion of a cliff, which would be a variable embodiment whose manifestations are the different states of erosion of the cliff. We find this theory very powerful, and especially appropriate to capture the intuition that the same process may go on at different times. However, its formal principles have been subject to some criticisms, mainly concerning the mereological structure of a variable embodiment. Moreover, since the notion of variable embodiment is very general, simply saying that processes are variable embodiments is not enough to understand their ontological nature. To address these concerns, in this paper we proceed in two phases: first, we propose a revised version of Fine's original theory adapted to the case of processes, which adopts a classical mereology instead of Fine's hylomorphic mereology, and a temporalized constitution relation in place of Fine's function of variable embodiment; second, we go deeper into the ontological nature of processes by revisiting the notions of homogeneity, intentionality, and telicity discussed in the literature, and propose an account based on ontological principles and not on semantic properties of predicates. This allows us to organize processes into a novel taxonomy based exclusively on their unity and individuation principles.},

  abstract = {The integration of the raster data cube alongside another form of geospatial data (e.g., vector data) raises considerable challenges when it comes to managing and representing it using knowledge graphs. Such integration can play an invaluable role in handling the heterogeneity of geospatial data and linking the raster data cube to semantic technology standards. Many recent approaches have been attempted to address this issue, but they often lack robust formal elaboration or solely concentrate on integrating raster data cubes without considering the inclusion of semantic spatial entities along with their spatial relationships. This may constitute a major shortcoming when it comes to performing advanced geospatial queries and semantically enriching geospatial models. In this paper, we propose a framework that can enable such semantic integration and advanced querying of raster data cubes based on the virtual knowledge graph (VKG) paradigm. This framework defines a semantic representation model for raster data cubes that extends the GeoSPARQL ontology. With such a model, we can combine the semantics of raster data cubes with features-based models that involve geometries as well as spatial and topological relationships. This could allow us to formulate spatiotemporal queries using SPARQL in a natural way by using ontological concepts at an appropriate level of abstraction. We propose an implementation of the proposed framework based on a VKG system architecture. In addition, we perform an experimental evaluation to compare our framework with other existing systems in terms of performance and scalability. Finally, we show the potential and the limitations of our implementation and we discuss several possible future works.},

Its primary purpose is to provide a schema consistent with the CIDOC CRM to integrate geoinformation using the conceptualiza-tions, formal definitions, encoding standards and topological relations defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium in GeoSPARQL. To build the ontology, the same ontology engineering methodology was used as in the CIDOC CRM. CRMgeo first introduced the concept of Spacetime volume that was subsequently included in the CIDOC CRM and provides a differentiation between phenomenal and declarative Spacetime volume, Place and Time-Span. Phenomenal classes derive their identity from real world phenomena like events or things and declarative classes derive their identity from human declarations like dates or coordinates. This differentiation is an essential conceptual background to link CIDOC CRM to the classes, topological relations and encodings provided by Geo-SPARQL and thus allowing spatiotemporal analysis offered by geoinformation systems based on the semantic distinctions of the CIDOC CRM. CRMgeo introduces the classes and relations necessary to model the spatiotemporal properties of real world phenomena and their topological and semantic relations to spatiotemporal information about these phenomena that was derived from historic sources, maps, observations or measurements. It is able to model the full chain of approximating and finding again a phenomenal place, like the actual site of a ship wreck, by a declarative place, like a mark on a sea chart.},

Their goal is to synthesize artificial samples, such as images, that are indistinguishable from authentic images. A common example of a GAN application is to generate artificial face images by learning from a dataset of celebrity faces. While GAN images became more realistic over time, one of their main challenges is controlling their output, i.e. changing specific features such pose, face shape and hair style in an image of a face. A new paper by NVIDIA, A Style-Based Generator Architecture for GANs (StyleGAN), presents a novel model which addresses this challenge. StyleGAN generates the artificial image gradually, starting from a very low resolution and continuing to a high resolution (1024x1024). By modifying the input of each level separately, it controls the visual features that are expressed in that level, from coarse features (pose, face shape) to},

  abstract = {Geospatial extensions of SPARQL, like GeoSPARQL and stSPARQL, have been defined since 2007 and while several geospatial RDF stores have implemented a substantial part of these extensions, other stores limited their support mostly on point geometry features. A parallel process with the above was that RDF frameworks evolved in an interesting way by presenting a more mature set of geospatial features, such as GeoSPARQL support and including the latest indexing technologies. As a logical consequence, a shift in the use of RDF frameworks is to be expected, from base platforms that users extend to create more complete geospatial RDF stores, to attractive finished RDF solutions for many geospatial applications. Alongside with the ever-increasing size of linked geospatial data that semantic stores need to handle, all the above provided our group the motivation to improve our single node systems benchmark Geographica, originally defined in 2013. Geographica 2 is more comprehensive, because it now includes new geospatial RDF stores and frameworks, big real world datasets of many hundred million triples with up to fifty million features of complex geometries, new tests and queries that reveal the scalability of these systems. The augmented and revised real world workload of Geographica 2 tests the efficiency of primitive spatial functions in RDF stores, their performance in the geocoding scenario against the new Census dataset in addition to many other real use case scenarios and finally includes computation of statistics for geospatial datasets. A more detailed and systematic evaluation is performed using the synthetic workload. The new scalability workload aims at discovering the limits of centralized geospatial RDF stores of various architectures. It employs a set of six well balanced real world datasets with highly complex geometries covering many European countries and compares three RDF stores in terms of storage space, bulk loading and query response time. In addition, a special version of the benchmark has been created for systems with limited geospatial functionality and two more systems of this category are introduced along the six systems of the main benchmark, all stressed against point-only subsets of the workloads. Three out of the eight systems use an RDBMS for the persistence layer, while some of them offer a variety of persistence options.},

This article reports the study on brassware intangible heritage knowledge base development using an ontological approach. The ontology modelling used Ontology Development 101. Content validation result by experts found that the brassware ontology is complete, consistent, concise, precise and clear. Evaluation results show that the experts agreed on content representation (mean {$\geq$} 3.80), and the ontology meets all the quality criteria (mean {$\geq$} 4.03). The brassware craft ontology contributes to the intangible heritage preservation effort for one of the almost extinct local culture and practices. This intangible heritage knowledge base can be applied for the development of semantic search, mobile and gaming applications to attract and disseminate heritage information to young people. Additionally, the ontological design can serve as a guide for the design and development of a knowledge base for other types of heritage.},

Traditionally, humans interact with geospatial data through software (e.g., ArcGIS 10.3) and programming languages (e.g., Python). As a pioneer study, we explore the possibility of using an LLM as an interface to interact with geospatial datasets through natural language. To achieve this, we also propose a framework to (1) train an LLM to understand the datasets, (2) generate geospatial SQL queries based on a natural language question, (3) send the SQL query to the backend database, (4) parse the database response back to human language. As a proof of concept, a case study was conducted on real-world data to evaluate its performance on various queries. The results show that LLMs can be accurate in generating SQL code for most cases, including spatial joins, although there is still room for improvement. As all geospatial data can be stored in a spatial database, we hope that this framework can serve as a proxy to improve the efficiency of spatial data analyses and unlock the possibility of automated geospatial analytics.},

Through field investigations, combined with cultural ecology theory, an ontology-based semantic web technology was proposed, and Nanjing ``Yunjin'' brocade weaving technique was selected as the research object. The specific steps were as follows: First, based on the field surveys and cultural ecology theory, the intangible cultural ecological environment was divided into natural and social environments. Next, constructing the intangible cultural heritage ontology was constructed, including the collection and collation of Nanjing Yunjin weaving technique knowledge corpus, based on user needs analysis and corpus analysis, CIDOC CRM was used to create rules to build the ontology. Finally, based on the MediaWiki platform and Semantic MediaWiki, the semantic web model of the intangible cultural heritage was designed, and its semantic retrieval function was realized, thereby achieving the practical application of intangible cultural heritage digitization. Based on the perspective of cultural ecology, a set of intangible digital application models was proposed, which expanded the digital application of the cultural ecology theory, verified the application of this model in the sustainable development of cultural tourism, and provided reference for the sustainable development of cultural tourism.},

  abstract = {Prediction of structural complexity for geohazard and subsurface resource applications requires constraining and interpreting data that are often ambiguous or lack key information. Moreover, structural complexity is a subjective term, requiring context for quantification. Recognizing this, a new knowledge-data framework and a geospatial fuzzy logic method is developed to represent and predict structural complexity in the subsurface. A conceptual model for known structural complexity serves as a basis for associating geospatial representations with types of damage zones. A second conceptual model for zones of structural complexity facilitates its prediction, notably in areas with limited explicit structural data. For each conceptual model, a fuzzy logic inference model is developed to incorporate geospatial data and estimate structural complexity potential. This approach is demonstrated using several public geospatial datasets within the state of Oklahoma. Explicit fault and earthquake location data were integrated using a fuzzy model of known structural complexity to train topographic, lithologic, and geophysical proxy datasets, applied to a fuzzy model to predict structural complexity, and evaluated with Receiver Operating Characteristic analyses and error classification. The final model output, displayed in maps and cross sections, offers comparison with interpreted structural data for validation. Together, these results demonstrate the effectiveness and limitations of the new approach as a screening tool for predicting structurally complex areas.},

The objective is to help structure application ontologies in areas where specific artefacts are present - in other words, virtually any area of activity. The conceptualization relies on recent philosophical and psychological research on artefacts, having resulted in a largely consensual theoretical basis. Furthermore, this ontology of artefacts extends the foundational DOLCE ontology and supplements its axiomatization. The conceptual primitives are as follows: artificial entity, intentional production of entities, (state of) capacity, capacity to play a role in actions of a given type, function and functional object. These primitives enable artefacts in general to be characterized as intentionally and successfully produced entities, and isolate an important subclass of ``technical'' artefacts to which a function is ascribed. Lastly, we emphasize the novelty of this ontology by comparing it with other works with similar objectives.},

It also examines the processes used to integrate hand-drawn map information into geocoded data points and provides recommendations for improving efficiency and precision. As a first step to integrate Jefferson County social service delivery into community-based comprehensive child welfare System of Care, both formal and informal services had to be identified. To identify existing resources at the community level, cognitive mapping, a process by which participants draw visual representations of geographical areas, was conducted with 247 participants in Jefferson County, Colorado. Over 3500 unique resources were identified and entered into a GIS -- ArcMap, a component of ArcView -- to analyze the availability, capacity, and distribution of social services in the county and within communities. Identification of community resources via cognitive mapping and GIS analysis provide (1) a comprehensive database of existing services; (2) a basis to build communication networks and cooperation among government and community providers; (3) the ability to create an efficient system that avoids duplication of efforts; (4) an understanding of the geographical distribution of resources; (5) the identification of resources lacking in the county and specific communities; and (6) knowledge differences among diverse participant groups.},

Second, it examines the theoretical applications or conceptual research, concerning cognitive maps role in the influencing and explaining spatial behaviour; spatial choice and decision making; wayfinding and orientation; and the cognitive maps utility and role as a mnemonic and metaphorical devise; a shaper of world and local attitudes and perspectives; and for creating and coping with imaginary worlds. Third, it discusses cognitive mapping's practical and applied worth, concerning the planning of suitable living environments; advertising; crime solving; search and rescue, geographical educational issues, cartography and remote sensing; and in the designing and understanding computer interfaces and databases, especially Geographical Information Systems (GISs).},

  abstract = {This introductory textbook teaches the simple development of geospatial applications based on the principles and software tools of geospatial data science. It introduces a new generation of geospatial technologies that have emerged from the development of the Semantic Web and the Linked Data paradigm, and shows how data scientists can use them to build environmental applications easily. Geospatial data science is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, and visualizing geospatial data. Since around 2010, there has been extensive work in the area of geospatial data science using semantic technologies and linked data, from researchers in the areas of the Semantic Web, Geospatial Databases and Geoinformatics. The main results of this research have been the publication of the OGC standard GeoSPARQL and the implementation of a number of linked data tools supporting this standard. Up to now, there has been no textbook that enables someone to teach this material to undergraduate or graduate students. The material of the book is developed in a tutorial style and it is appropriate for an introductory course on the subject. This can be an advanced undergraduate course or a graduate course offered by Computer Science or GIS faculty. It is a hands-on approach and every chapter contains exercises that help students master the material. The book is accompanied by a Web site: https://ai.di.uoa.gr/geospatial-data-science-book/index.html where solutions to some of the exercises are given together with supplementary material such as datasets and code. Most of the material in the book has been tried in the ``Knowledge Technologies'' course taught by the editor in the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens since 2012.},

However, RDF can only represent thematic metadata and needs to be extended if we want to model spatial and temporal information. For this purpose, we develop the data model stRDF and the query language stSPARQL. stRDF is a constraint data model that extends RDF with the ability to represent spatial and temporal data. stSPARQL extends SPARQL for querying stRDF data. In our extension to RDF, we follow the main ideas of constraint databases and represent spatial and temporal objects as quantifier-free formulas in a first-order logic of linear constraints. Thus an important contribution of stRDF is to bring to the RDF world the benefits of constraint databases and constraint-based reasoning so that spatial and temporal data can be represented in RDF using constraints.},

The notion of event is taken to be more primitive than that of time and both are represented explicitly by means of Horn clauses augmented with negation by failure. The main intended applications are the updating of databases and narrative understanding. In contrast with conventional databases which assume that updates are made in the same order as the corresponding events occur in the real world, the explicit treatment of events allows us to deal with updates which provide new information about the past. Default reasoning on the basis of incomplete information is obtained as a consequence of using negation by failure. Default conclusions are automatically withdrawn if the addition of new information renders them inconsistent. Because events are differentiated from times, we can represent events with unknown times, as well as events which are partially ordered and concurrent.},

The authors suggest that this overestimation occurs, in part, because people who are unskilled in these domains suffer a dual burden: Not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it. Across 4 studies, the authors found that participants scoring in the bottom quartile on tests of humor, grammar, and logic grossly overestimated their test performance and ability. Although their test scores put them in the 12th percentile, they estimated themselves to be in the 62nd. Several analyses linked this miscalibration to deficits in metacognitive skill, or the capacity to distinguish accuracy from error. Paradoxically, improving the skills of the participants, and thus increasing their metacognitive competence, helped them recognize the limitations of their abilities.

On the other hand, storytelling tools rarely support the larger chains of data practices, which are required to generate and shape the data and visualizations needed for such stories. This paper introduces the InTaVia platform, which has been developed to bridge these gaps. It supports the practices of data retrieval, creation, curation, analysis, and communication with coherent visualization support for multiple types of entities. We illustrate the added value of this open platform for storytelling with four case studies, focusing on (a) the life of Albrecht D{\"u}rer (person biography), (b) the Saliera salt cellar by Benvenuto Cellini (object biography), (c) the artist community of Lake Tuusula (group biography), and (d) the history of the Hofburg building complex in Vienna (place biography). Numerous suggestions for future research arise from this undertaking.},

Existing models, however, do not capture gender-related concepts. This article presents an effort to fill this gap by developing a new ontology for the representation of gendered concepts in CH resources.1 The new ontology, named `GenderedCHContents' resulted from combined research in women's studies, gender theory and computer science. Its primary aim is to draw attention to the presence of women within CH artefacts. The proposed ontology extends the Europeana Data Model (EDM) with twenty-two new classes, sixteen object properties and seven datatype properties. The article presents a demonstration of the `GenderedCHContents' ontology's use in five different representation tasks, which describe five resources related to Pandora's myth. Lastly, the study stresses the benefits of reasoning support (i.e. enabling computers to infer further information from a set of asserted facts) in revealing different gender ideals and inferred relationships between metaphorical concepts, along with the benefits of the Semantic Web in making information about gendered contents more easily retrievable to the users.},

In this paper we show how Earth Observation data, ontologies, and linked geospatial data can be combined for the development of a wildfire monitoring service that goes beyond applications currently deployed in various Earth Observation data centers. The service has been developed in the context of European project TELEIOS that faces the challenges of extracting knowledge from Earth Observation data head-on, capturing this knowledge by semantic annotation encoded using Earth Observation ontologies, and combining these annotations with linked geospatial data to allow the development of interesting applications.},

We refer to virtual actions in our talk. This suggests that we are committed to the existence of virtual actions, because otherwise it would be di cult to see what would make our talk about them true. Actions are usually categorized as a subclass of events. It is common to treat talk about actions as being about events. If talk about actions entails a commitment to events, then talk about virtual actions seems to entail a commitment to virtual events. Is a commitment necessary to make sense of talk about what goes on in computer games and online communities? It will be argued that the epistemological bene ts gained by admitting virtual actions and virtual events are bought at too high an ontological cost. An alternative account is proposed with an arguably better theoretical cost-bene t ratio.},

In addition to their geometric shapes, geographic features have names, sometimes different in diverse languages.

The scope of geographic information retrieval is to search for geographic information not against a database, but against the whole Internet: but the Internet stores information in different languages, and it is of paramount importance not to remain stuck to a unique language. In this paper, our first step is to clarify the links between geographic objects as computer representations of geographic features, ontologies and gazetteers designed in various languages. Then, we propose some inference rules for matching not only types, but also relations in geographic ontologies with the assistance of gazetteers.},

By then, however, they had produced essays that remain among the best defenses ever written for both literature and its theory. Included here are four essays representing key points in the formalists' short history. Victor Shklovsky's pioneering "Art as Technique" (1917) defines the literary as a way to make us see familiar things as if for the first time. His 1921 essay on Tristram Shandy makes that eccentric novel the centerpiece for a theory of narrative. A section from Boris Tomashevsky's "Thematics" (1925) inventories the elements of stories. In "The Theory of the 'Formal Method'" (1927), Boris Eichenbaum defends Russian Formalism against various attacks. An able champion, he describes Formalism's evolution, notes its major figures and works, clears away decayed axioms, and rescues literature from "primitive historicism" and other dangers. These essays set a course for literary studies that led to Prague structuralism, French semiotics, and postmodern poetics.

Silk heritage vocabulary comes from multiple sources that have been mixed up across time and space. This has led to the use of different terminology in specialized organizations in order to describe their artifacts. This makes data interoperability between independent catalogues very difficult. Moreover, the interaction level of existing resources is low, most complex queries are not possible and results are poorly shown.

However, the manual annotation of process models is cumbersome and sometimes even hardly manageable taking the size of taxonomies into account. In this paper, we present the first approach for automatically annotating process models with the concepts of a taxonomy. Our approach builds on the corpus-based method of second-order similarity, different similarity functions, and a Markov Logic formalization. An evaluation with a set of 12 process models consisting of 148 activities and the PCF taxonomy consisting of 1,131 concepts demonstrates that our approach produces satisfying results.},

We further address the use of such a shared knowledge in a VE under the knowledge model defined in this paper to help partner selection by proposing assessment criteria of potential partners. We suggest that value ranges as thresholds to filter unable biddings before evaluation should be a better way. Filtering process works well for its fitting with the dynamic criteria of the principal agent during the process of selection partners in a VE.

  abstract = {Various kinds of engineering software and digitalized equipment are widely applied through the lifecycle of industrial products. As a result, massive data of different types are being produced. However, these data are hysteretic and isolated from each other, leading to low efficiency and low utilization of these valuable data. Simulation based on theoretical and static model has been a conventional and powerful tool for the verification, validation, and optimization of a system in its early planning stage, but no attention is paid to the simulation application during system run-time. With the development of new-generation information and digitalization technologies, more data can be collected, and it is time to find a way for the deep application of all these data. As a result, the concept of digital twin has aroused much concern and is developing rapidly. Dispute and discussions around concepts, paradigms, frameworks, applications, and technologies of digital twin are on the rise both in academic and industrial communities. After a complete search of several databases and careful selection according to the proposed criteria, 240 academic publications about digital twin are identified and classified. This paper conducts a comprehensive and in-depth review of these literatures to analyze digital twin from the perspective of concepts, technologies, and industrial applications. Research status, evolution of the concept, key enabling technologies of three aspects, and fifteen kinds of industrial applications in respective lifecycle phase are demonstrated in detail. Based on this, observations and future work recommendations for digital twin research are presented in the form of different lifecycle phases.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel clickbait detection method. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art techniques from the fields of deep learning and metric learning, integrating them into the Case-Based Reasoning methodology. This provides the model with the ability to learn-over-time, adapting to different users' criteria. Our experimental results also evidence that the proposed approach outperforms previous clickbait detection methods by a large margin.},

However, conventional geovisualization techniques of narratives often encounter several prominent challenges, including the data acquisition \& integration challenge and the semantic challenge. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose the idea of narrative cartography with knowledge graphs (KGs). Firstly, to tackle the data acquisition \& integration challenge, we develop a set of KG-based GeoEnrichment toolboxes to allow users to search and retrieve relevant data from integrated cross-domain knowledge graphs for narrative mapping from within a GISystem. With the help of this tool, the retrieved data from KGs are directly materialized in a GIS format which is ready for spatial analysis and mapping. Two use cases --- Magellan's expedition and World War II --- are presented to show the effectiveness of this approach. In the meantime, several limitations are identified from this approach, such as data incompleteness, semantic incompatibility, and the semantic challenge in geovisualization. For the later two limitations, we propose a modular ontology for narrative cartography, which formalizes both the map content (Map Content Module) and the geovisualization process (Cartography Module). We demonstrate that, by representing both the map content and the geovisualization process in KGs (an ontology), we can realize both data reusability and map reproducibility for narrative cartography. {\copyright} 2022, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Digital Libraries (DLs), especially in the Cultural Heritage domain, are rich in narratives. Every digital object in a DL tells some kind of story, regardless of the medium, the genre, or the type of the object. However, DLs do not offer services about narratives, for example it is not possible to discover a narrative, to create one, or to compare two narratives. Certainly, DLs offer discovery functionalities over their contents, but these services merely address the objects that carry the narratives (e.g. books, images, audiovisual objects), without regard for the narratives themselves. The present work aims at introducing narratives as first-class citizens in DLs, by providing a formal expression of what a narrative is. In particular, this paper presents a conceptualisation of the domain of narratives, and its specification through the Narrative Ontology (NOnt for short), expressed in first-order logic. NOnt has been implemented as an extension of three standard vocabularies, i.e. the CIDOC CRM, FRBRoo, and OWL Time, and using the SWRL rule language to express the axioms. On the basis of NOnt, we have developed the Narrative Building and Visualising (NBVT) tool, and applied it in four case studies to validate the ontology. NOnt is also being validated in the context of the Mingei European project, in which it is applied to the representation of knowledge about Craft Heritage.},

This paper discusses how urban knitting, a collaborative textile craft augmenting public space, incorporates various online practices to facilitate urban participation. We conducted a survey with 40 urban knitters to identify the roles technologies play in their practices. The results illustrate how the participants use digital tools for personal inspiration, global collaboration, individual self-expression and collective meaning-making around their craft. Through discussing how technologies can re-contextualise creative craft practices, we contribute insights into how a wider understanding of hybrid craft is needed to embrace new design opportunities within this hybrid realm of urban citizenship.},

In this paper, we focus on the image-sentence retrieval task, where the objective is to efficiently find relevant images for a given sentence (image-retrieval) or the relevant sentences for a given image (sentence-retrieval). Computer vision literature reports the best results on the image-sentence matching task using deep neural networks equipped with attention and self-attention mechanisms. They evaluate the matching performance on the retrieval task by performing sequential scans of the whole dataset. This method does not scale well with an increasing amount of images or captions. In this work, we explore different preprocessing techniques to produce sparsified deep multi-modal features extracting them from state-of-the-art deep-learning architectures for image-text matching. Our main objective is to lay down the paths for efficient indexing of complex multi-modal descriptions. We use the recently introduced TERN architecture as an image-sentence features extractor. It is designed for producing fixed-size 1024-d vectors describing whole images and sentences, as well as variable-length sets of 1024-d vectors describing the various building components of the two modalities (image regions and sentence words respectively). All these vectors are enforced by the TERN design to lie into the same common space. Our experiments show interesting preliminary results on the explored methods and suggest further experimentation in this important research direction.},

As the world is heading towards the fourth industrial revolution, the implicit utilization of artificial-intelligence-enabled semantic web technologies paves the way for many real-time application developments. The fundamental building blocks for the overwhelming utilization of semantic web technologies are ontologies, and it allows sharing as well as reusing the concepts in a standardized way so that the data gathered from heterogeneous sources receive a common nomenclature, and it paves the way for disambiguating the duplicates very easily. In this context, the right utilization of ontology capabilities would further strengthen its presence in many web-based applications such as e-learning, virtual communities, social media sites, healthcare, agriculture, etc. In this paper, we have given the comprehensive review of using the semantic web in the domain of healthcare, some virtual communities, and other information retrieval projects. As the role of semantic web is becoming pervasive in many domains, the demand for the semantic web in healthcare, virtual communities, and information retrieval has been gaining huge momentum in recent years. To obtain the correct sense of the meaning of the words or terms given in the textual content, it is deemed necessary to apply the right ontology to fix the ambiguity and shun any deviations that persist on the concepts. In this review paper, we have highlighted all the necessary information for a good understanding of the semantic web and its ontological frameworks.},

  abstract = {Since the end of the 20th century the widespread use of digital applications in archaeology has legitimized their inclusion in the archaeological toolbox. Together with archaeological sciences, databases, GIS and other computer-based methods are nowadays present in every respectable archaeological investigation. This makes archaeology a peculiar discipline, where the scientific method combines with the historical one to produce new knowledge. However, the large availability of archaeological data creates the risk of a data deluge and may suggest using online information just to collect previous interpretations rather than to re-use the data supporting them. A `Grand Challenges' list compiled some years ago includes important research questions that undergird contemporary issues and require an appropriate digital methodology to be addressed. The present paper discusses the benefits, or better the absolute need, of a data-centric methodology to address large-scale research. It argues that an acritical use of the so-called `Big Data' approach may be questionable. It suggests how the combination of artificial intelligence with human intelligence is the key to progress into the understanding of phenomena of paramount societal importance for researchers and for the public at large.},

In the context of the Web, incomplete information issues have been studied in detail for XML, but very few papers exist that do the same for RDF. In this paper we make the first general proposal for extending RDF with the ability to represent property values that exist but are unknown or partially known using constraints. Following ideas from incomplete information literature, we develop a semantics for this extension of RDF, called RDFi, and study query evaluation for SPARQL. We transfer the concept of representation systems from incomplete information in relational databases to the case of RDFi and identify two very important fragments of SPARQL that can be used to define a representation system for RDFi. The first corresponds to the monotone fragment of graph patterns that uses only the operators AND, UNION, and FILTER. The second corresponds to the well-designed graph patterns, that is, a fragment that uses only operators AND, FILTER, and OPT, and enjoys interesting properties that make query evaluation efficient. We prove that each of the two fragments can be used to define a representation system for CONSTRUCT queries without blank nodes in their templates. We also define the fundamental concept of certain answers to SPARQL queries over RDFi databases and present an algorithm for its computation. Then, we present complexity results for computing certain answers by considering equality, temporal, and spatial constraint languages and the class of CONSTRUCT queries of our representation systems. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of RDFi in geospatial Semantic Web applications by giving a number of examples and comparing the modeling capabilities of RDFi with related formalisms found in the literature.},

  abstract = {The amount of digital cultural heritage data produced by cultural heritage institutions is growing rapidly. Digital cultural heritage repositories have therefore become an efficient and effective way to disseminate and exploit digital cultural heritage data. However, many digital cultural heritage repositories worldwide share technical challenges such as data integration and interoperability among national and regional digital cultural heritage repositories. The result is dispersed and poorly-linked cultured heritage data, backed by non-standardized search interfaces, which thwart users' attempts to contextualize information from distributed repositories. A recently introduced geospatial semantic web is being adopted by a great many new and existing digital cultural heritage repositories to overcome these challenges. However, no one has yet conducted a conceptual survey of the geospatial semantic web concepts for a cultural heritage audience. A conceptual survey of these concepts pertinent to the cultural heritage field is, therefore, needed. Such a survey equips cultural heritage professionals and practitioners with an overview of all the necessary tools, and free and open source semantic web and geospatial semantic web platforms that can be used to implement geospatial semantic web-based cultural heritage repositories. Hence, this article surveys the state-of-the-art geospatial semantic web concepts, which are pertinent to the cultural heritage field. It then proposes a framework to turn geospatial cultural heritage data into machine-readable and processable resource description framework (RDF) data to use in the geospatial semantic web, with a case study to demonstrate its applicability. Furthermore, it outlines key free and open source semantic web and geospatial semantic platforms for cultural heritage institutions. In addition, it examines leading cultural heritage projects employing the geospatial semantic web. Finally, the article discusses attributes of the geospatial semantic web that require more attention, that can result in generating new ideas and research questions for both the geospatial semantic web and cultural heritage fields.},

The resulting languages and environments -although technically successful-did not receive much attention from industry. On the contrary, researchers and practitioners have recently started experimenting with the usage of UML as a PML. Being so popular and widely used, UML has an important competitive advantage compared to any specialized PML. However, it has also a main limitation. While most PMLs are executable by some process engine, UML was conceived as a non-executable, semi-formal language. The work described here aims at assessing the possibility of employing a subset of UML as an executable PML. The article proposes a formalization of the semantics of the UML subset and presents the translation of UML process models into code, which can be enacted in the OPSS process-centered environment. The paper also presents a case study to validate the approach. We expect that process modeling by means of UML is easier and available to a larger community of software process managers. Moreover, process enactment makes the process more efficient, reliable, predictable and controllable, as widely shown by previous research.},

The requirement of Allen operators for complete temporal knowledge goes against the monotonic knowledge generation sequence, which is witnessed in observation driven fields like stratigraphy.

To address this deficiency, we introduce a set of basic temporal primitives, which comprise the minimum possible and yet sufficient temporal knowledge, between associated time intervals. This flexible representation can describe any Allen operator as well as scenarios with further temporal generalization using logical conjunctions.

Semantic annotation constitutes the first step to enrich such text with the necessary information for producing analytical maps. The present article focuses on the disambiguation of spatial named entities (SNE) by the attribution of an identifier of the ever-growing Web of Data. This giant knowledge base (KB) provides qualitative spatial information about geographic entities, in particular spatial relations such as (:Paris :southOf :Lille), (:Paris :country :France). We thus propose a graph-matching algorithm relying on the A* algorithm and graph-edit distances for choosing the best referent in the KB for the SNE. We performed preliminary experiments and noted the clear gain in performance. We propose some examples of maps that are built semi-automatically. Finally, we draw conclusions and describe our plans of future work.},

HCs are part of history and have impact upon the economy of the areas in which they flourish. Despite their~cultural significance, efforts towards HC digital representation and presentation are scattered. In this chapter, as a first step towards the Representation and Presentation of Heritage Crafts as cultural heritage (CH), pertinent requirements and needed technological components are investigated. Representation is expected to capture the wide spectrum of knowledge that a HC covers, from objects and their making, to hand gestures and tool uses that define craft motor skills, to the societal value, economic impact, and historical significance of HCs. Presentation is expected to address the need of exploiting Representation to conserve cultural resources, contribute to their accurate interpretation, provide essential and authentic experiences, as well as stimulate revenues of cultural resources through thematic tourism. This chapter lays the foundations and envisions the further development and formalisation of a suitable approach to HC representation and presentation in the form of a generic protocol that together with the appropriate technological tools can be applied to any HC instance.},

One promising application area for ontologies is Virtual Reality (VR). Developing a VR application is very time consuming and requires skilled people. Introducing ontologies in the development process can eliminate these barriers. We have developed an approach, VR-WISE, which uses ontologies for describing a Virtual Environment (VE) at a conceptual level. In this paper we will describe the Behavior Ontology, which defines the modeling concepts for object behavior. Such an ontology has several advantages. It improves the intuitiveness; facilitates cross-platform VR development; smoothens integration with other ontologies; enhances the interoperability of VR applications; and allows for more intelligent systems.},

  abstract = {Spatial and temporal data are critical components in many applications. This is especially true in analytical applications ranging from scientific discovery to national security and criminal investigation. The analytical process often requires uncovering and analyzing complex thematic relationships between disparate people, places and events. Fundamentally new query operators based on the graph structure of Semantic Web data models, such as semantic associations, are proving useful for this purpose. However, these analysis mechanisms are primarily intended for thematic relationships. In this paper, we describe a framework built around the RDF data model for analysis of thematic, spatial and temporal relationships between named entities. We present a spatiotemporal modeling approach that uses an upper-level ontology in combination with temporal RDF graphs. A set of query operators that use graph patterns to specify a form of context are formally defined. We also describe an efficient implementation of the framework in Oracle DBMS and demonstrate the scalability of our approach with a performance study using both synthetic and real-world RDF datasets of over 25 million triples.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has proven its effectiveness in numerous tasks for remote sensing scene understanding. However there is an increasing interest to explore fusion of domain-specific background information to the deep neural network to further improve its performance. Remote sensing researchers are also working towards developing models that generalize and adapt to multiple applications. Generalization challenges coupled with the scarcity of large corpora of high-quality noise-free labelled data, have together fueled an interest for leveraging background information. Knowledge graphs serve as excellent choice to represent domain-specific information in a structured, standardized and extensible manner. Integrating symbolic knowledge representations in the form of Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) to perform neuro-symbolic reasoning is an emerging research direction promising significant impacts. This vision paper seeks to position ideas and provoke early thoughts toward advancing neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence in the context of geospatial challenges. Specifically, it conceptualizes and elaborates on an architecture for infusing geospatial knowledge from knowledge graph in a deep neural network pipeline. As guiding case studies - land-use land-cover classification, object detection and instance segmentation can benefit from infusing spatio-contextual information with remote sensing imagery. The discussion further reflects on and articulates the challenges and explainable AI opportunities anticipated when scaling and maintaining large-scale geospatial knowledge graphs.},

To accelerate progress in this direction, we organized the Clickbait Challenge 2017, a shared task inviting the submission of clickbait detectors for a comparative evaluation. A total of 13 detectors have been submitted, achieving significant improvements over the previous state of the art in terms of detection performance. Also, many of the submitted approaches have been published open source, rendering them reproducible, and a good starting point for newcomers.

In this paper we approach the definition of new methodologies for the visualization and the exploration of the dynamics at play in real dynamic social networks. We present a recently introduced formalism called TVG (for time-varying graphs), which was initially developed to model and analyze highly-dynamic and infrastructure-less communication networks such as mobile ad-hoc networks, wireless sensor networks, or vehicular networks. We discuss its applicability to complex networks in general, and social networks in particular, by showing how it enables the specification and analysis of complex dynamic phenomena in terms of temporal interactions, and allows to easily switch the perspective between local and global dynamics. As an example, we chose the case of scientific communities by analyzing portion of the ArXiv repository (ten years of publications in physics) focusing on the social determinants (e.g. goals and potential interactions among individuals) behind the emergence and the resilience of scientific communities. We consider that scientific communities are at the same time communities of practice (through co-authorship) and that they exist also as representations in the scientists' mind, since references to other scientists' works is not merely an objective link to a relevant work, but it reveals social objects that one manipulates, select and refers to. In the paper we show the emergence/selection of a community as a goal-driven preferential attachment toward a set of authors among which there are some key scientists (Nobel prizes).},

  abstract = {The information system (T.V., newspapers, blogs, social network platforms) and its inner dynamics play a fundamental role on the evolution of collective debates and thus on the public opinion. In this work we address such a process focusing on how the current inner strategies of the information system (competition, customer satisfaction) once combined with the gossip may affect the opinions dynamics. A reinforcement effect is particularly evident in the social network platforms where several and incompatible cultures coexist (e.g, pro or against the existence of chemical trails and reptilians, the new world order conspiracy and so forth). We introduce a computational model of opinion dynamics which accounts for the coexistence of media and gossip as separated but interdependent mechanisms influencing the opinions evolution. Individuals may change their opinions under the contemporary pressure of the information supplied by the media and the opinions of their social contacts. We stress the effect of the media communication patterns by considering both the simple case where each medium mimics the behavior of the most successful one (in order to maximize the audience) and the case where there is polarization and thus competition among media reported information (in order to preserve and satisfy their segmented audience). Finally, we first model the information cycle as in the case of traditional main stream media (i.e, when every medium knows about the format of all the others) and then, to account for the effect of the Internet, on more complex connectivity patterns (as in the case of the web based information). We show that multiple and polarized information sources lead to stable configurations where several and distant opinions coexist.},

  abstract = {Despite the increasing diffusion of the Internet technology, TV remains the principal medium of communication. People's perceptions, knowledge, beliefs and opinions about matter of facts get (in)formed through the information reported on by the mass-media. However, a single source of information (and consensus) could be a potential cause of anomalies in the structure and evolution of a society. Hence, as the information available (and the way it is reported) is fundamental for our perceptions and opinions, the definition of conditions allowing for a good information to be disseminated is a pressing challenge. In this paper starting from a report on the last Italian political campaign in 2008, we derive a socio-cognitive computational model of opinion dynamics where agents get informed by different sources of information. Then, a what-if analysis, performed trough simulations on the model's parameters space, is shown. In particular, the scenario implemented includes three main streams of information acquisition, differing in both the contents and the perceived reliability of the messages spread. Agents' internal opinion is updated either by accessing one of the information sources, namely media and experts, or by exchanging information with one another. They are also endowed with cognitive mechanisms to accept, reject or partially consider the acquired information.},

  abstract = {Con la ristampa anastatica della rivista <<Il Lavoratore>>Giuseppe Rapelli pu{\`o} essere annoverato tra i protagonisti della vita sindacale, associazionistica e politica nell'Italia del '900. Dopo la militanza nello scenario torinese del primo dopoguerra, al sorgere del fascismo si trov{\`o} giovanissimo alla guida dell'organizzazione sindacale cristiana torinese e nello stesso periodo condivise, sul terreno politico, la breve stagione del Partito Popolare. Nel secondo dopoguerra seppe affiancare la presenza sul piano locale alle nuove funzioni esercitate in ambito nazionale, sia in campo politico come membro dell'Assemblea costituente e successivamente come parlamentare democristiano, sia in campo sindacale dapprima come segretario della CGL unitaria per la corrente cristiana e come promotore, poi, di un tentativo di rinascita del sindacalismo cattolico.In questo volume il figlio di Giuseppe Rapelli ricostruisce le tappe dell'impegno giovanile del padre, riservando particolare attenzione alle esperienze sindacali e alle emblematiche vicende legate alla rivista <<Il Lavoratore>>. Pubblicata dal gennaio al settembre 1926, in essa si ritrovano infatti vari temi al centro del vivo dibattito dell'epoca, nel quale associazioni e movimenti, partiti e istituzioni si confrontarono con la progressiva chiusura di ogni spazio democratico da parte del regime fascista.<<Nella Torino di Gramsci e Gobetti, Rapelli rappresenta una delle espressioni della cultura sociale e politica di matrice cattolica che sostiene l'esigenza di un aperto e coraggioso confronto, che vuole condurre su un terreno comune rivendicazioni, diritti, aspirazioni e progetti del movimento operaio. [...] Il personaggio appare indubbiamente scomodo (nel sindacato, nel partito, nelle organizzazioni cattoliche) e tale rimarr{\`a} anche successivamente, spesso al centro di contrasti e polemiche. Accanto ad una figura non sempre compresa e spesso isolata, emerge nel contempo e con altrettanta evidenza il personaggio coerente, il militante disinteressato, il convinto assertore dei propri ideali perseguiti con tenacia, diffidente verso i facili compromessi e le scorciatoie accomodanti>>.Dalla Prefazione di Walter E.

Actions on objects typically occur within matched formats: physical actions on physical objects, virtual actions on virtual objects, or mental actions on mental objects. Instead, I explore the theoretical and instructional implications of a 3\,{\texttimes}\,3 taxonomy that creates nine combinations of physical, virtual, and mental actions with physical, virtual, and mental objects. Following a description of each combination, I discuss the implications of the taxonomy for generic characteristics of instruction that apply across representational formats and taxonomic differences in which format matters. I then compare the proposed taxonomy to three other recent taxonomies including a taxonomic analysis of encoding that defines encoding as a relation between two entities (an iconic, motoric, phonetic, or semantic code) in which information in the first entity is used by the second entity. A comprehensive theory of manipulatives will require specifying the interconnections among theories that range from a small grain size in which the representation of actions differs from the representation of objects to a large grain size represented in embedded/embodied theories of cognition.},

On the 22nd of November 2022, ChatGPT was released to the public and has quickly become a popular source of information, serving as an effective question-answering and knowledge gathering resource. Early indications have suggested that it may be drawing users away from traditional question answering services such as Stack Overflow, raising the question of how it may have impacted Wikipedia. In this paper, we explore Wikipedia user metrics across four areas: page views, unique visitor numbers, edit counts and editor numbers within twelve language instances of Wikipedia. We perform pairwise comparisons of these metrics before and after the release of ChatGPT and implement a panel regression model to observe and quantify longer-term trends. We find no evidence of a fall in engagement across any of the four metrics, instead observing that page views and visitor numbers increased in the period following ChatGPT's launch. However, we observe a lower increase in languages where ChatGPT was available than in languages where it was not, which may suggest ChatGPT's availability limited growth in those languages. Our results contribute to the understanding of how emerging generative AI tools are disrupting the Web ecosystem.},

  abstract = {Although the computational properties of the Region Connection Calculus RCC-8 are well studied, reasoning with RCC-8 entails several representational problems. This includes the problem of representing arbitrary spatial regions in a computational framework, leading to the problem of generating a realization of a consistent set of RCC-8 constraints. A further problem is that RCC-8 performs reasoning about topological space, which does not have a particular dimension. Most applications of spatial reasoning, however, deal with two- or threedimensional space. Therefore, a consistent set of RCC-8 constraints might not be realizable within the desired dimension. In this paper we address these problems and develop a canonical model of RCC-8 which allows a simple representation of regions with respect to a set of RCC-8 constraints, and, further, enables us to generate realizations in any dimension d {$\geq$} 1. For threeand higher-dimensional space this can also be done for internally connected regions.},

Aspects of the model have been revised to align more closely with the IFLA LRM model, such as the handling of aggregation and representative expression attributes. Properties have been added to correspond to certain IFLA LRM relationships between works and expressions that were not declared in FRBRoo. The classes that represent the creation events of the main WEMI classes, F27 Work Creation and F28 Expression Creation, were revised.

An interesting question to ask, from the viewpoint of the history of computing, is whether or not these operations are sufficient for universal computation. The paper shows that, in fact, a single program loop containing these arithmetical instructions can simulate any Turing machine whose tape is of a given finite size. This is done by simulating conditional branching and indirect addressing by purely arithmetical means. Zuse's Z3 is therefore, at least in principle, as universal as today's computers that have a bounded addressing space. A side effect of this result is that the size of the program stored on punched tape increases enormously}

Despite the copious amounts of text available on the web, a significant portion remains unstructured, presenting a substantial barrier to the automatic construction and enrichment of KGs. To address this issue, we introduce an enhanced Doc-KG model, a sophisticated approach designed to transform unstructured documents into structured knowledge by generating local KGs and mapping these to a target KG, such as Wikidata. Our model innovatively leverages syntactic information to extract entities and predicates efficiently, integrating them into triples with improved accuracy. Furthermore, the Doc-KG model's performance surpasses existing methodologies by utilizing advanced algorithms for both the extraction of triples and their subsequent identification within Wikidata, employing Wikidata's Unified Resource Identifiers for precise mapping. This dual capability not only facilitates the construction of KGs directly from unstructured texts but also enhances the process of identifying triple mentions within Wikidata, marking a significant advancement in the domain. Our comprehensive evaluation, conducted using the renowned WebNLG benchmark dataset, reveals the Doc-KG model's superior performance in triple extraction tasks, achieving an unprecedented accuracy rate of 86.64\%. In the domain of triple identification, the model demonstrated exceptional efficacy by mapping 61.35\% of the local KG to Wikidata, thereby contributing 38.65\% of novel information for KG enrichment. A qualitative analysis based on a manually annotated dataset further confirms the model's excellence, outshining baseline methods in extracting high-fidelity triples. This research embodies a novel contribution to the field of knowledge extraction and management, offering a robust framework for the semantic structuring of unstructured data and paving the way for the next generation of KGs.},

Ontology as an instrument to represent knowledge has been studied and applied in various fields such as information science, knowledge engineering, artificial intelligence, or digital library. In the field of ontology and design, ontology can be applied in knowledge sharing. Using methontology approach, ontology modeling and implementation are developed to identify patterns and concepts of knowledge related to Craft Convection SMEs.},

  abstract = {Public History: A Practical Guide explores history in the public sphere and examines the variety of skills that historians require in the practice of public history. It discusses how through various mediums of interpretation and presentation a range of actors, which include museums, archives, government agencies, community history societies and the media and digital media, make history accessible to a wider audience. It provides the reader with an overview of the wider-world application and communication of history beyond the classroom through core case studies for each sector that include ideas for best practice 'in the field'.This book offers an accessible and engaging synopsis of a topic that has not previously been covered. By focusing on an area of study that has changed substantially in the last decade, Public History: A Practical Guide presents a comprehensive outline of the practice of 'public history', and provides ideas for future methodological approaches as well as a reference point for planning professional development in order to gain future employment in these sectors.In the current economic climate, students need to understand the potential use of history beyond university; this book contains the tools and advice needed for them to get one step ahead in terms of knowledge, skills and experience.},

The model is based on the foundational ontology DOLCE+DnS Ultralight (DUL) and provides comprehensive support to represent time and space, objects and persons, as well as mereological, causal, and correlative relationships between events. In addition, the Event-Model-F provides a flexible means for event composition, modeling event causality and event correlation, and representing different interpretations of the same event. The Event-Model-F is developed following the pattern-oriented approach of DUL, is modularized in different ontologies, and can be easily extended by domain specific ontologies.},

  abstract = {Ever since the vision was formulated, the Semantic Web has inspired many generations of innovations. Semantic technologies have been used to share vast amounts of information on the Web, enhance them with semantics to give them meaning, and enable inference and reasoning on them. Throughout the years, semantic technologies, and in particular knowledge graphs, have been used in search engines, data integration, enterprise settings, and machine learning. In this paper, we recap the classical concepts and foundations of the Semantic Web as well as modern and recent concepts and applications, building upon these foundations. The classical topics we cover include knowledge representation, creating and validating knowledge on the Web, reasoning and linking, and distributed querying. We enhance this classical view of the so-called "Semantic Web Layer Cake" with an update of recent concepts that include provenance, security and trust, as well as a discussion of practical impacts from industry-led contributions. We conclude with an outlook on the future directions of the Semantic Web. This is a living document.

APT is based on the notion of a free process, a new category in ontology, with Broad's / Sellars' "subjectless" or "pure" processes as their closest cognates. With a pointer to verbal and nominal aspect shift as background motivation I argue that basic classificatory terms of common sense reasoning (activity, event, thing, stuff, property etc.) can be treated as different types of free processes. After introducing essential elements of the formal framework of APT (a non-standard extensional mereology with a non-transitive part-relation) I sketch APT-classifications of basic and complex processes, based on five main descriptive parameters: homomerity pattern, participant structure, dynamic composition, dynamic shape, and dynamic context.},

This risk has been increasing under the impact of climate change, and in summer 2007 approximately 200,000 ha of vegetated land were burnt. The SEVIRI sensor, on board the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) geostationary satellite, is the only spaceborne sensor providing five and 15-minute observations of Europe in 12 spectral channels, including a short-wave infrared band sensitive to fire radiative temperature. In August 2007, when the bulk of the destructive wildfires started in Greece, the receiving station, operated by the Institute for Space Applications and Remote Sensing, provided us with a time series of MSG-SEVIRI images. These images were processed in order to test the reliability of a real-time detection and tracking system and its complementarity to conventional means provided by the Fire Brigade. EUMETSAT's Active Fire Monitoring (FIR) image processing algorithm for fire detection and monitoring was applied to SEVIRI data, then fine-tuned according to Greek conditions, and evaluated. Alarm announcements from the Fire Brigade's archives were used as ground truthing data in order to assess detection reliability and system performance. During the examined period, MSG-SEVIRI data successfully detected 82\% of the fire events in Greek territory with less than 1\% false alarms.},

Dieser Fl{\"u}gel wurde um die Mitte des 17. Jh. um ein Stockwerk erh{\"o}ht, in dem die repr{\"a}sentativen S{\"a}le und eine Galerie Platz fanden, die von den besten zeitgen{\"o}ssischen K{\"u}nstlern der Toscana und Emilia (Volterrano, Chiavistelli, Ciseri, Gemignani, Colonna und Mitelli) freskiert wurden, um so den pr{\"a}chtigen Rahmen f{\"u}r die bedeutende Kunstsammlung der Niccolini zu bilden. Diese F{\"o}rderung der K{\"u}nste durch Filippo di Giovanni Niccolini (1586-1666) fand eine w{\"u}rdige Fortsetzung durch Lorenzo di Matteo Niccolini (1632-1715) und seine Frau Contessa del Bufalo, die zwischen 1706 und 1708 einige Nachbarh{\"a}user an der Via dei Servi in einen neuen Bauk{\"o}rper einbeziehen und die vorhandenen Strukturen modernisieren lie{\ss}en gem{\"a}{\ss} den Vorstellungen der Zeit, die ger{\"a}umige Zimmerfolgen mit reichen Dekorationen in Stuck und Malerei vorsahen. Diese Erneuerung, {\"a}u{\ss}erlich in n{\"u}chternen Formen und weit entfernt von der Monumentalit{\"a}t des benachbarten Cinquecento-Palastes, mu{\ss}te im 4. Jahrzehnt des 18. Jahrhunderts als der W{\"u}rde eines adeligen Hauses unangemessen erscheinen, und folglich wurden zwei Architekten mit dem Entwurf eines neuen Palastes beauftragt, der die vorhandenen Bauk{\"o}rper ersetzen sollte: der Florentiner Ferdinando Ruggieri und der in Rom t{\"a}tige Pietro Hostini. Ihre Projekte, die alle beide nicht zur Ausf{\"u}hrung gelangten, zeichnen sich aus durch ihre grandiosen Ausma{\ss}e und ihre Prachtentfaltung und sind zugleich wichtige Belege f{\"u}r den kulturellen Austausch zwischen Florenz und Rom, dem f{\"u}hrenden k{\"u}nstlerischen Zentrum dieser Jahrzehnte. Ruggieri, der gro{\ss}herzogliche Architekt, der seit den 20er Jahren in Beziehung zu den Niccolini stand, entwarf eine Fassade, in der sich neomanieristische Elemente, die der akademischen Florentiner Kultur der Zeit verpflichtet sind, mit Anregungen borrominesker Richtung und des r{\"o}mischen Fr{\"u}hbarock verbinden, womit er in die N{\"a}he des von dem r{\"o}mischen Architekten Francesco Fontana entworfenen Palazzo Capponi gelangt. Hostini, Mitglied der Accademia di S. Luca und nachmals Architekt der p{\"a}pstlichen Regierungspal{\"a}ste, entwickelte drei Projekte, unter denen das erste hervorsticht: hier sind Schemata von Bernini (Palazzo Chigi Odescalchi, Palazzo Barberini) mit Motiven von Borromini verschmolzen, indem die Stockwerke durch ein strenges System von Vertikalen und Horizontalen artikuliert werden, das auch die architektonischen Sch{\"o}pfungen eines Ferdinando Fuga, Nicola Salvi oder Antonio Valeri (Palazzo Chigi Zondadari in Siena) pr{\"a}gt. Die Projekte der beiden bisher nicht ausreichend erforschten Architekten sind also Zeugnisse f{\"u}r die sch{\"o}pferische Auseinandersetzung mit der architektonischen Avantgarde der 1730er Jahre und zugleich f{\"u}r den auf der H{\"o}he seiner Zeit stehenden Geschmack des Auftraggebers, Giovanluca Niccolini, der als Pr{\"a}lat in Rom lebte. Wahrscheinlich wegen der erh{\"o}hten Kosten des Hostini-Projektes bevorzugten die Niccolini das des Ruggieri, der seinen eigenen Fassadenri{\ss} in einem Kupferstich ver{\"o}ffentlichte, und begannen den Umbau mit den drei S{\"a}len des Piano nobile {\"u}ber dem kleinen Garten --- Arbeiten, die mit der Ausmalung von Vincenzo Meucci 1759 ihren Abschlu{\ss} fanden. Im {\"U}brigen behielt der Palast sein urspr{\"u}ngliches Aussehen, da die von Ruggieri vorgesehene Modernisierung unterblieb, die eine der bedeutendsten Sp{\"a}tbarock-Architekturen in Florenz hervorgebracht h{\"a}tte.},

For example, people who are opposed to the minimum wage are likely, after talking to each other, to be still more opposed; people who tend to support gun control are likely, after discussion, to support gun control with considerable enthusiasm; people who believe that global warming is a serious problem are likely, after discussion, to insist on severe measures to prevent global warming.  This general phenomenon -- group polarization -- has many implications for economic, political, and legal institutions. It helps to explain extremism, "radicalization," cultural shifts, and the behavior of political parties and religious organizations; it is closely connected to current concerns about the consequences of the Internet; it also helps account for feuds, ethnic antagonism, and tribalism. Group polarization bears on the conduct of government institutions, including juries, legislatures, courts, and regulatory commissions. There are interesting relationships between group polarization and social cascades, both informational and reputational. Normative implications are discussed, with special attention to political and legal institutions.},

Some applications, however, will require training in real-time on live video streams with a human-in-the-loop. We refer to this class of problem as time-ordered online training (ToOT). These problems will require a consideration of not only the quantity of incoming training data, but the human effort required to annotate and use it. We demonstrate and evaluate a system tailored to training an object detector on a live video stream with minimal input from a human operator. We show that we can obtain bounding box annotation from weakly-supervised single-point clicks through interactive segmentation. Furthermore, by exploiting the time-ordered nature of the video stream through object tracking, we can increase the average training benefit of human interactions by 3-4 times.},

  year = {2021},
  abstract = {Geodesists work in Industry 4.0 and Spatial Information Management by using cross linked machines, people and data. Yet, one of the most popular technologies for interlinking data Semantic Web technologies - have been largely absent from the geodesy community, because of the slow development of standards, a mandatory non-trivial conversion between geospatial features and graph data, and a lack of commonly available GIS tools to achieve this. This is slowly changing due to an increased awareness of the advantages of Linked Data technology in the GIS community and an improvement of standards in the Semantic Web community. Hence, the importance of open source software, open geodata and open access increases. A fundamental requirement for data sharing is the use of standardised data models. In this paper we compare two different modelling approaches for Irish Ogham Stones as a best practice example for linked open data management: One approach uses Wikidata, and the other a custom ontology. While Wikidata offers direct integration into the Linked Open Data Cloud and needs less technological expertise, using a custom ontology enables the creation of best-fitting data models. Both approaches facilitate the use of new information sources for the geodesy community. We aim to demonstrate how Linked Open Geodata can be re-used and further enriched with information from other open sources such as spatial data from OpenStreetMap. For this purpose, we also present a QGIS plugin and a modified geospatial web service, as well as a geo-optimised Linked Data browser, as solutions for bridging the gap between geospatial features and Linked Open Data triples.},

  abstract = {An extension of process modeling languages is designed which allows representing the semantics of model element labels which are formulated in natural language by using concepts of a formal ontology. This combination of semiformal models with formal ontologies will be characterized as semantic process modeling. The approach is exemplarily applied to the languages EPC (Event-driven Process Chain), BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation) and OWL (Web Ontology Language) and is generalized by means of an information model. The proposed formalization of the semantics of individual model elements in conjunction with the usage of inference engines allows the improvement of query functionalities in modeling tools and enables new possibilities of model validation. The integration of the approach in the IT-based work environments of modelers is demonstrated by a system architecture and a prototypical implementation. Evidently, advantages in the areas of modeling, model management, IT-business alignment, and compliance can be achieved by the application of modeling tools augmented with semantic technologies.},

The Simple Event Model (SEM) is created to model events in these various domains, without making assumptions about the domain-specific vocabularies used. SEM is designed with a minimum of semantic commitment to guarantee maximal interoperability. In this paper, we discuss the general requirements of an event model for web data and give examples from two use cases: historic events and events in the maritime safety and security domain. The advantages and disadvantages of several existing event models are discussed in the context of the historic example. We discuss the design decisions underlying SEM. SEM is coupled with a Prolog API that enables users to create instances of events without going into the details of the implementation of the model. By a tight coupling to existing Prolog packages, the API facilitates easy integration of event instances to Linked Open Data. We illustrate use of the API with examples from the maritime domain.},

  abstract = {Lies spread faster than the truth There is worldwide concern over false news and the possibility that it can influence political, economic, and social well-being. To understand how false news spreads, Vosoughi et al. used a data set of rumor cascades on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. About 126,000 rumors were spread by {$\sim$}3 million people. False news reached more people than the truth; the top 1\% of false news cascades diffused to between 1000 and 100,000 people, whereas the truth rarely diffused to more than 1000 people. Falsehood also diffused faster than the truth. The degree of novelty and the emotional reactions of recipients may be responsible for the differences observed. Science, this issue p. 1146 We investigated the differential diffusion of all of the verified true and false news stories distributed on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. The data comprise {\textasciitilde}126,000 stories tweeted by {\textasciitilde}3 million people more than 4.5 million times. We classified news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98\% agreement on the classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it. A large-scale analysis of tweets reveals that false rumors spread further and faster than the truth.

In this study, a semantic-enhanced modeling method for ontology modeling and rules building is proposed, which can be used for river water quality monitoring and relevant data observation processing. The observational process ontology (OPO) method can describe the semantic properties of water resources and observation data. In addition, it can provide the semantic relevance among the different concepts involved in the observational process of water quality monitoring. A pollution alert can be achieved using the reasoning rules for the water quality monitoring stations. In this study, a case is made for the usability testing of the OPO models and reasoning rules by utilizing a water quality monitoring system. The system contributes to the water quality observational monitoring process and traces the source of pollutants using sensors, observation data, process models, and observation products that users can access in a timely manner.},

  abstract = {The pervasive smart manufacturing is bringing increasing attention to digital twin. As a core part of virtual modeling, 3D virtual modeling is crucial to improve the intuitiveness of state monitoring, enhance human-cyber interactions, visualize conditions and simulations, and provide visual guides in digital twin. However, although 3D virtual modeling in digital twin has many benefits for different applications, its complex characteristics become obstacles for novice engineers to develop and utilize. Besides, research information about 3D virtual modeling in digital twin is too scattered, while there has been no literature review that specially and comprehensively summarizes and analyzes it. To help novice engineers understand and scheme 3D virtual modeling in digital twin for future research and applications, this paper reviews 106 digital twin 3D modeling cases with their characteristics, including deployment targets, purposes \& roles, collaborative models, data flows, the autonomy of 3D modeling, fidelity, twinning rates, enabling technologies, and enabling tools. This paper then discusses and analyzes the review outcomes via statistics. Finally, this paper also proposes a thinking map for scheming the 3D virtual modeling in digital twin. In general, 3D virtual modeling is oriented by the motivation behind different digital twins, engineers hence should reflect on the purposes, scenarios, resources, and long-term visions of their projects. When designing characteristics of 3D virtual modeling, engineers must consider functions, capabilities of data processing and transmission, timeliness of data, applicability, and specialty of each characteristic. For future work, this paper highlights three important research issues to realize the prospect of 3D virtual modeling, including the versatility of autonomous 3D modeling, incremental updates of 3D models, and optimal planning of data collections for 3D modeling. Besides, future work will also investigate the enhancement of 3D virtual modeling via relevant information technologies, such as IoT-based data collections, machine vision-based data processing, and adaptive machine learning-based dynamic modeling.},

  abstract = {Cultural heritage is the legacy of physical artefacts and intangible attributes of a group or society that is inherited from past generations. Vases are among the most iconic objects of cultural heritage. In the context of this work, we have focused on Chinese ceramic vessels of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) and the Qing dynasty (1644-1911). There are many collections of vases in different museums in China. Although some of these collections have been digitised, they are rarely accessible in an open format and remain isolated. In addition, the lack of clearly identified terminologies is an obstacle to communication and knowledge sharing.Our work aims to respond to this issue by implementing practices drawn from the semantic web and knowledge engineering, and more particularly by building in a W3C format an ontology dedicated to the Chinese vases of the Ming and Qing dynasties.The construction of the TAO CI ("ceramic" in Chinese) ontology respects the experts' way of thinking in their conceptualization of the field, and takes into account the international standards in Terminology (ISO 1087 and ISO 704). Both approaches are based on the notion of essential characteristic and define a concept as a unique combination of characteristics. The search for differences between objects, combined with a morphological analysis of Chinese terms whose characters carry meaning in relation to knowledge of the field, allows to identify essential characteristics. The definition of concept is based on the idea that a concept is a set of essential characteristics stable enough to be named in language. We have thus proposed a specific method for building ontologies guided by the terms and essential characteristics of the domain. We have introduced new terms (neologisms) in English and concepts without any designation in language for ontology structuring purposes. The definition of terms in natural language follows the Aristotelian definition. It is based on the formal definition of concepts denoted by the terms.The construction of the ontology was done using Prot{\'e}g{\'e}, the most widely used environment for building ontologies in the W3C format (RDF/OWL). As the notion of essential characteristic does not exist in Description Logic, it was necessary to translate them. We have proposed some principles to this end. The terminological dimension was reduced, as is often the case, to annotations (in SKOS, RDFS) on the concepts. The TAO CI ontology is linked to external resources such as CIDOC CRM and ATT Getty for the conceptual part, and to museums for the objects. Finally, the TAO CI ontology was evaluated from the point of view of the domain (coverage) and its implementation. The ontology is in open access at the following address: http://www.dh.ketrc.com/otcontainer/data/OTContainer.owlThe last phase of the project consisted in the creation of a dedicated website. This site provides access to the different resources of the project and in particular to a bilingual (English, Chinese) electronic dictionary of the vases of the Ming and Qing dynasties. The dictionary entries correspond to the OWL classes of the ontology: http://www.dh.ketrc.com/The TAO CI ontology is, to our knowledge, the first open and reusable ontology in the format of the semantic web of Chinese ceramic vases. It is an illustration of an approach guided by terms and essential characteristics that can be applied to the construction of ontologies in other areas of Chinese cultural heritage.},

Terminology is a tool for the dissemination and communication of cultural heritage. The lack of clearly identified terminologies is an obstacle to communication and knowledge sharing.

Our work aims to respond to this issue by implementing practices drawn from the Semantic Web and ISO Terminology standards (ISO 704 and ISO 1087-1) and more particularly, by building in a W3C format ontology as knowledge infrastructure to construct a multilingual terminology e-Dictionary. The Chinese ceramic vases of the Ming and Qing dynasties are the application cases of our work. The method of building ontology is the `term-and-characteristic guided method', which follows the ISO principles of Terminology. The main result of this work is an online terminology e-Dictionary. The terminology e-Dictionary could help archaeologists communicate and understand the concepts denoted by terms in different languages and provide a new perspective based on ontology for the digital protection of cultural heritage.

We show that scaling up feature selection efforts to heuristically identify better-performing feature subsets catapults the performance of the baseline classifier to second rank overall, beating 12 other competing approaches and improving over the baseline performance by 20\%. This demonstrates that traditional classification approaches can still keep up with deep learning on this task.},

Evaluating an existing ontology or adapting it is a labor-intensive and complex task for which no automated tools exist. Nevertheless, in this paper we propose a tool that aims at making this vision come true, i.e., we present a tool for the automated evaluation of ontologies that allows one to rapidly assess an ontology's coverage of a domain and identify specific problems in the ontology's structure. The tool evaluates the domain coverage and correctness of parent-child relations of a given ontology based on domain information derived from a text corpus representing the domain. The tool provides both overall statistics and detailed analysis of sub-graphs of the ontology. In the demo, we show how these features can be used for the iterative improvement of an ontology.},

In this paper, we describe the solution for the Zingel Clickbait Detector at the Clickbait Challenge 2017, which is capable of evaluating each tweet's level of click baiting. We first reformat the regression problem as a multi-classification problem, based on the annotation scheme. To perform multi-classification, we apply a token-level, self-attentive mechanism on the hidden states of bi-directional Gated Recurrent Units (biGRU), which enables the model to generate tweets' task-specific vector representations by attending to important tokens. The self-attentive neural network can be trained end-to-end, without involving any manual feature engineering. Our detector ranked first in the final evaluation of Clickbait Challenge 2017.},

The algebraic approach has been proven to be an effective way to process queries, and algebraic operations in RDF have been investigated extensively. However, the study of spatiotemporal RDF algebra has just started and still needs further attention. This paper aims to explore an algebraic operational framework to represent the content of spatiotemporal data and support RDF graphs. To accomplish our study, we defined a spatiotemporal data model based on RDF. On this basis, the spatiotemporal semantics and the spatiotemporal algebraic operations were investigated. We defined five types of graph algebras, and, in particular, the filter operation can filter the spatiotemporal graphs using a graph pattern. Besides this, we put forward a spatiotemporal RDF syntax specification to help users browse, query, and reason with spatiotemporal RDF graphs. The syntax specification illustrates the filter rules, which contribute to capturing the spatiotemporal RDF semantics and provide a number of advanced functions for building data queries.},

There is quite a lot of spatiotemporal information in Semantic Web, and recent works focus on not only general data but also spatiotemporal data. Existing efforts are mainly to add spatiotemporal labels to RDF, which expand RDF triple into quad or quintuple. However, extra labels often cause additional overhead for the system and lead to inefficient information organization management. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose an stRDFS model by labeling properties with spatiotemporal features and the corresponding determination methods of topological relations among different spatiotemporal entities. stRDFS considers spatiotemporal attribute as a part of the RDF model, which can record spatiotemporal information without changing the current RDF standard. Our approach improves the ability of recording and linking spatiotemporal data. More importantly, depending on formatting of spatiotemporal attributes in stRDFS, it will improve the semantic inferring ability, and the users are not required to be familiar with the underlying representations of spatiotemporal data.},

However, in such a disintermediated environment misinformation is pervasive and attempts to debunk are often undertaken to contrast this trend. In this work, we examine the effectiveness of debunking on Facebook through a quantitative analysis of 54 million users over a time span of five years (Jan 2010, Dec 2014). In particular, we compare how users usually consuming proven (scientific) and unsubstantiated (conspiracy-like) information on Facebook US interact with specific debunking posts. Our findings confirm the existence of echo chambers where users interact primarily with either conspiracy-like or scientific pages. However, both groups interact similarly with the information within their echo chamber. Then, we measure how users from both echo chambers interacted with 50,220 debunking posts accounting for both users consumption patterns and the sentiment expressed in their comments. Sentiment analysis reveals a dominant negativity in the comments to debunking posts. Furthermore, such posts remain mainly confined to the scientific echo chamber. Only few conspiracy users engage with corrections and their liking and commenting rates on conspiracy posts increases after the interaction.},

The widespread presence of a heterogeneous mass of information sources may affect the mechanisms behind the formation of public opinion. Such a scenario is a florid environment for digital wildfires when combined with functional illiteracy, information overload, and confirmation bias. In this essay, we focus on a collection of works aiming at providing quantitative evidence about the cognitive determinants behind misinformation and rumor spreading. We account for users' behavior with respect to two distinct narratives: a) conspiracy and b) scientific information sources. In particular, we analyze Facebook data on a time span of five years in both the Italian and the US context, and measure users' response to i) information consistent with one's narrative, ii) troll contents, and iii) dissenting information e.g., debunking attempts. Our findings suggest that users tend to a) join polarized communities sharing a common narrative (echo chambers), b) acquire information confirming their beliefs (confirmation bias) even if containing false claims, and c) ignore dissenting information.},
